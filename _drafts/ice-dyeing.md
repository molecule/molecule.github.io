## Materials
- Large bucket for mixing soda ash, and soaking fabric in soda ash water.
- Method for draining fabric.
- Large bucket for catching draining dye fabric (can be same bucket as above).
- Dyes. I have 131 Imperial Purple, 64 Orchid, 188 Bluebird, 25 Turquoise, 43 Blue Violet, 112 Periwinkle, and 13 Fuchsia Red. Of these, PR13  Fuchsia Red, PR25 Turquoise* (T), and PR188 Bluebird are "pure (non-mixed) Fiber Reactive Dye Colors". These are "made for mixing and easier to use when making gradation (ombre') effects" according to the [(4)][4]. "Fuchsia can vary from a light pink to a dark Magenta just by varying the quantity of dye used"[(4)][4].

## Calculations
- Soda ash: 2 cups per gallon of water according to the [Dharma Trading Company Ice Dye instructions(1)][1]. OR  about 1 lb. Soda Ash per 4 oz. of dye is needed when garment dyeing OR 1lb. Soda Ash per 3 lbs of fabric as a pre-soak when tie-dyeing according to the information in the [Dharma Trading Company Soda Ash purchase area(2)][2].

In my case I had 14oz of cotton fabric, so I needed 0.3 pounds of soda ash.

## Steps
1. Soak your dyeable fabric in the soda wash water for 15 minutes[(1)][1].
2. Follow the rest of the instructions in [(1)][1] and [(3)][3].
