### Dolomites

#### Getting there and away
Rome2Rio is a fantastic site for searching for transportation. It shows lots of different options, price, timing, etc. HOWEVER - one thing I learned is that some of the buses (and maybe trains?) are seasonal. For example, Rome2Rio shows a daily bus that leaves from Venice to Listolade (a teeny town in the Dolomites), but it turns out it only runs from July-August! I found this out only by emailing the bus company. Luckily there are other options, but this was a pretty big surprise when I discovered it initially.
