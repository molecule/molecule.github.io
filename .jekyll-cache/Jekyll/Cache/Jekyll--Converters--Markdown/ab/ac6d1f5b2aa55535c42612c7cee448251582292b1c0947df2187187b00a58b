<p>A Circus adaptation of Alice in Wonderland: Created and Performed by the Advanced Training Program of the Clown Conservatory of the San Francisco Circus Center</p>

<p>Alice‚Äôs adventures in Wonderland have never before been told like this‚Ä¶with clowns, acrobats, jugglers, and musicians. When Alice searches for a way back home, she will meet the caterpillar, the white rabbit, and she will have to escape from the dreaded Queen of Hearts. You may think you know this classic story, but hold on to your hats, because this world premiere created by master clown Jeff Raz of Cirque Du Soleil for the Advanced Training Program of the Clown Conservatory and produced by Active Arts will be the wildest, craziest trip to Wonderland you‚Äôve ever taken!
