## REBUTTAL ADVICE
(From Wendy Mackay, Scott Klemmer, Gene Golovchinsky and Bjoern Hartmann)
Wendy: Rebuttals are usually the most emotionally charged part of writing a paper. Remember that, no matter what the reviews say, you need to respond in a polite, clear and factual manner. Your goal is not to argue with the reviewers, but rather to convince the program committee that your paper is worth accepting. This is a tricky writing exercise, no matter how much experience you have.

### Two principles from Scott Klemmer at Stanford:

1) Focus on *the changes you will make*. i.e., have the rebuttal be
forward-looking. (Rather than offering your opinion of the reviews.)
Summarizing revisions that will appear is an easy way to generate
positive energy. And demonstrate that you understand the concerns.
Disagreeing with reviewers is sometimes essential, but most often
should be a minor part of the review, not the centerpiece. And don't
recapitulate your favorite part of the review. The reviewers can read.
2) Show, don't tell. *Don't* say, "In revision, we will compare our
work to Cosby '83's Jello Paper." Say, "The primary distinction
between our work and Cosby '83 is the use of carrots. We will explain
this and add the reference in revision." Don't say, "In revision, we
will present statistic Y instead of / in addition to statistic X."
Say, "Statistic Y is __. We will present this instead of / in addition
to statistic X." In other words, don't *say* what you will do. Do it,
and summarize the upshot in the rebuttal.

Bjoern would add:
1) Address the most significant issues first, and smaller clarifications last. Issues raised by the 1AC or 2AC are often especially relevant, as they have distilled multiple reviews for you, and they will be present when the paper is discussed.
2) Use headings (e.g., IN CAPITAL LETTERS) to signal what topic is addressed in which paragraph.
3) Mention the reviewers who raised each issue (e.g., R1, R3 question
our use of a t-test...)
4) Keep it positive and show that you believe you have a real
contribution! Grumbling will not change anyone's mind.
Some more advice from Gene Golovchinsky at FXPAL:

1) Start with a few deep breaths. [...] Be factual. Rhetoric and
invective will not help your case.
2) Understand the big complaints reviewers might have had, and whether
these are fatal flaws in your work, or aspects that can be corrected.
Look to the meta-review to see what items the Associate Chair thought
were important among the litany collected by the reviewers. The
meta-review should highlight the important shortcomings; addressing
those will improve your chances of acceptance.
3) Make sure reviewers know what the takeaway from your paper was.
This is the elevator pitch for your paper, and you should have it
nailed. Sometimes reviewers don’t read the paper as carefully as you’d
like them to, so adding a bit of emphasis here may help alert them to
what’s important about the work.
4) One useful tactic for writing a rebuttal is to offer concrete
changes that are responsive to reviewers’ comments.
5) If the reviewers didn’t understand your analysis, or wanted to see
a different cut at it, put some details of the analysis (numbers
help!) right into the rebuttal with the explanation that you’ll add it
to the paper.
6) Get someone impartial to read the reviews and your rebuttal, and
ask them to comment on the tone as well as on the facts.

### A rebuttal writing schedule from Wendy Mackay:
#### Day one:  All authors
- Read the reviews and mark anything you agree with or disagree with.
  - If you disagree strongly, wait for 24 hours before you start to respond

#### Day two:  Primary author
- Begin by rereading all of the reviews.
- Turn the Associate Chair's review into a numbered list
  - You need to convince the AC to fight for your paper so focus on his/her comments.
  - Check the other reviews for details, but focus on how they relate to the AC's review
- Reread your paper, from the reviewers' perspective
  - Mark any relevant sections and the critique number
  - For each critique
    - Draft an initial response, including any quotes from your paper
      - Do not worry about length yet
    - Send your annotated list of critiques to your co-authors
    - Choose a time to meet - usually in 24-48 hours

#### Day two: Co-authors
- Read the list of critiques
- Identify what you think are most important
- Add comments
  - Was the critique interpreted correctly?
  - Do you have additional ideas on how to respond?
  - Do you have specific wording suggestions?
  - Send your prioritized, annotated list to the primary author

#### Day three: All co-authors
- Prior to the meeting
  - Someone should compile the annotated comments
  - Everyone should reread the AC's review and the comments
- At the meeting
  - Decide who is responsible for the concise form of the rebuttal
  - Discuss the best approach to respond to each critique
    - Specific actions trump generalities
    - If you disagree, say so, but politely and with justification
  - Note that it helps to think of the AC as an advocate for your paper, you are giving them reasons for them to argue on your behalf.
  - Note too that this is an excellent time to discuss any legitimate critiques so that you can improve the paper, whether for this round or the next.
  - After the meeting, you're ready to make a complete draft of the rebuttal
    - Set aside some uninterrupted quiet time
    - Space is limited, so focus on your top priorities
      - Always begin by thanking the reviewers
      - Highlight their positive comments
         - Work through the critiques in order of priority
 
Remember:
  - Polite, factual rebuttals can save a paper
  - Angry or snarky rebuttals will probably kill your paper
  - If you don't write a rebuttal, it will be interpreted negatively and probably kill your paper
  - Send the rebuttal to your co-authors for comments
    - If it is too long, they should suggest what to cut
      - reword to be concise
      - remove or reduce less important items

#### Day four:
- Once your co-authors are happy, find at least one non-author to review the rebuttal
