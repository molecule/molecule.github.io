<p>Amidst the hysteria of the Second World War after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19,1942. It authorized 120,000 American citizens of Japanese ancestry to be removed from their homes. They were all relocated to remote internment camps in the western U.S. ‚Äì 11,000 of them were confined in Topaz.
Using a Japanese tea set, a table cloth, sand, brown paper and an old suitcase, Lunatique Fantastique uses puppetry to create the heart-wrenching story of one family‚Äôs forced evacuation from their home in Berkeley to the camp in Utah. This show,  originally written in response to past political climates, resonates just as strongly today with the recent violation of American‚Äôs civil rights.</p>

<p>‚ÄúE.O. 9066‚Ä≤ (is) serious stuff‚Ä¶.timely‚Ä¶a reflection on the erosion of civil liberties in times of national crisis‚Ä¶performed (with) the‚Ä¶ensemble‚Äôs usual, often astonishingly creative use of found objects.‚Äù - Rob Hurwitt, SF Chronicle</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn a nearly silent 60-minute puppet show‚Ä¶(the ensemble) creates more emotion and eloquence than most dialogue-filled plays can produce in two hours‚Ä¶one stirring image after another.  Chalk up another amazing adventure in puppetry for the remarkable‚Ä¶cast of Lunatique Fantastique.‚Äù - Chad Jones, ANG Newspapers</p>
