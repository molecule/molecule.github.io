## Venice
Normally, Venice isn't the kind of place I'd go on a vacation (dense city), but since we had to go there for a conference I was presenting at, we accepted it and made the best of it. Venice is extremely unique: there are no cars, the whole area is basically a bunch of islands, loosely connected via bridges. It has that classic old European twisty, windy road feel, and it's absolutely wild to walk around in. My favourite thing about visiting such a unique place for such a long time (we were there for over a week) was slowly learning all the neighborhoods, and an area that I struggled to find the first day was a comfortable, easy landmark later in the trip. 

### Recs
To be completely, 100% honest, we found that most restaurants in Venice are just not that great: there are so many tourists and it's so difficult to bring food in I think it's easy to just aim for the lowest common denominator. In particular the 10 million restaurants with buskers were extremely mediocre. However, there were a few gems: In general, the more effort you had to put in to visiting the restaurant (advance reservation, difficult to find), definitely the better. Here are my faves:





## Dolomites

#### Getting there and away
- Rome2Rio is a fantastic site for searching for transportation. It shows lots of different options, prices, schedules, etc. HOWEVER - one thing I learned is that some of the buses (and maybe trains?) are seasonal. For example, Rome2Rio shows a daily bus that leaves from Venice to Listolade (a teeny town in the Dolomites), but it turns out it only runs from July-August! I found this out only by emailing the bus company. Luckily there are other options, but this was a pretty big surprise when I discovered it initially. Additionally, if two legs of a trip are on the same TYPE of conveyance (i.e., both buses), then Rome2Rio shows them both as the same colour, making it hard to notice that there's a transfer. This kinda bit us in the booty when we were coming back from the Dolomites, because our bus that we THOUGHT would take us in to Venice proper actually dumped us at the airport, where we needed to transfer to another bus to get to the island.
- In general it was quite difficult to figure out which parts of the "AV1" were accessible by car, and which weren't. We didn't want to follow the traditional/recommended route, so I needed to figure out how to get us into / out of the mountains.
