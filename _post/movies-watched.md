        title: The Incredibles
        review: I love all Pixar. Animation quality hasn't held up over 14 years. I'm excited to see the new one and compare.

        title: Ocean's 8
        review: Mindy Kaling is a treasure. Anne Hathaway was great. Rihanna stole her scenes. First 10 mins were phenomenal, then the momentum hit a brick wall and never recovered speed (crucial for comedy), so it really dragged.

        title: Deadpool 2
        review: Surely we can do better than the same stereotypical jokes about Indian dudes? LOVE Zazie Beatz as Domino. Most interesting scenes involve her getting "lucky."

        title: Avengers Infinity War
        review: Fun. Good. Devastating. LOVE Holland as Spiderman. As Tim says, "the film offers no emotions of its own but the one the viewer comes in with."

        title: A Quiet Place
        review: I do not like horror movies but this was fun, weird, and creative. Wish I'd seen it in a theatre since the live experience sounds thrilling.
        rating: 2.5

        title: Annihilation
        review: So weird, so pretty, very fun.

        title: Game Night
        review: It's not great but....what do you want. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams (one of the prettiest women alive) play characters who are in over their heads. I love how the couple seems to actually like and support each other. Great cameo by the excellent Chelsea Peretti.

        title: Black Panther
        review: Excellent. Best avenger's movie so far probably.

        title: The Post
        review: Surprisingly dull for a film with Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and Spielberg! It was fine. Streep is phenomenal.

        title: The Greatest Showman
        review: Ugh. I love musicals *and* the circus but I hated this. Boring, poppy songs (except the excellent power anthem by the Bearded Lady), thin characters, and not anything fun to make up for it.

        title: I, Tonya
        review: Really good. This event featured surprisingly large in my childhood (maybe the first "viral" news story I remember? That and Jon-Benet Ramsey's murder), so it was an interesting experience in nostalgia to see it on-screen. Cool and weird framing. Margot Robbie is excellent and Allison Janney is in top form (one of my all-time faves).

        title: Disaster Artist
        review: The Room was a weird experience when I first saw it while living w 6 roommates (two of whom are now famous comedians!) in section 8 housing in a not-great neighborhood in SF at the height of the 2008 recession. This movie is very well-done. James Franco deserves an Oscar.

        title: Coco
        review: Lovely, wonderful, culturally sensitive. I saw this AT Pixar before it was released, and they had a large exhibit about all the research they had done, and it was really beautifully done.

        title: Thor Ragnarok
        review: Fun! Jeff Goldblum is bizarre and I cannot look away when he's on-screen. Cate Blanchett does a great job with not much to work with. Waititi as the rock-monster was excellent. "It's not like a regular circle, it's a freaky circle." My fave avengers film to rewatch.

        title: Lucky Logan
        review: Fun! Great weird characters. Has the double-reveal that I loved about Ocean's 11.

        title: Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets
        review: Worth watching on a plane if you're incredibly bored and just want to look at weird pretty stuff. Blisteringly misogynistic. Fashion/food scene with the large hat/plate was my favourite part. Oh also the weird dual-dimension shopping mall was awesome.

        title: Dunkirk
        review: Really enjoyed this even though it's slow and boring. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing score. Unclear why Christopher Nolan is hell-bent on obscuring Tom Ford's face but the trend continues.

        title: The Shape of Water
        review: Worst movie of the last 10 years easily. So boring. So cliched. So stupid. I cannot BELIEVE this won Best Picture.

        title: The Big Sick
        review: Can't really say "fun" but I enjoyed it! The trailer oversold it as a comedy. It's better going in thinking it's kind of dark.

        title: Rogue One A Star Wars Story
        review: This was so great! Alan Tudyk as K-2SO was excellent. Diego Luna's heavily accented non-villain was marvelous. Very fun.

        title: Hidden Figures
        review: Such an important story! So glad this was made. I did NOT like the white savior scene where the white male boss smashed the bathroom sign...

        title: La La Land
        review: Think about who I am, and what I've done, and decide for yourself that it was never any question that I was going to really like this movie. And then there's this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abn6cPxrc5w">excellent SNL sketch.</a>

        title: Sully
        review: We saw this movie in a theatre filled with old white men who seemed extremely gratified to watch Tom Hanks play an old white man who triumphs over technology and beaucracy to save the day. I'll watch Hanks in anything.

        title: Star Wars - The Force Awakens
        review: Harrison Ford brings back the goofy affable Han Solo I know and love (fave character from the first movie). Rey is wonderful. Finn is wonderful, and Oscar Isaac is also super great. Classic Star Wars while still feeling fresh. BB-8!!! Oh, also, having a "dark side" character tempted by the light is actually FASCINATING.
