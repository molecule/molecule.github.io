## Basic Kindle
- 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34”

## Aura H20
- Color-shifting light so you filter out blue light during the day.
- Slightly larger than I'd like at 6.8 by 5.1 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 7.4 ounces
- Sounds like it has excellent battery life: "seven hours of reading—over five days, and I still had well over 85 percent of battery life left." [src](https://www.pcmag.com/review/327370/kobo-aura-h2o)
- 8 GB of storage
