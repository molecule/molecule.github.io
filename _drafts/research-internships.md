## Job Opportunities in HCI for Graduate Students
CHI panel focused on internships and other job opportunities available to graduate students.

My experiences: Interned at Snapchat, Microsoft (and Qualcomm as an undergrad)

What matters to you: Team? Project? For me: 

1. Where to find them.
Personal and professional connections. Advisor. "Networking" (Twitter).

2. How to pick them. Project fit

- Timing
Where you're at in your PhD career. Early on: you can be more flexible, and work on projects that aren't necessarily directly related to what may end up being your thesis. Later: you may want to be more selective, and it can be difficult to find a good fit between what your thesis needs and what a company is looking for / working on. Example: I was at Snapchat between my 3rd and 4th year, when a lot of my dissertation ideas were non-existent and that was great, because I was able to be totally open to whatever project they were working on. This summer I'll be back at Microsoft, and the project I'll be working on is not directly related to my dissertation which could be seen as "slowing me down" but I LOVED the team so much and learned so much last summer, so I see it as continuing to learn. 

- Skills focus
Can be strategic about what skills you might be able to build, even if the project fit might not be perfect. For example, maybe you'll design and run a large-scale study and be able to work with a statistics expert on analysis and study design. I had that experience at Snapchat, and it was EXCELLENT - way more valuable than any statistics course.

Most HCI PhD programs train you well to do other jobs, becuase you've likely had total ownership over your research, planning, etc. You end up wearing so many hats that you may qualify for a higher level when you join a company. You have done so many jobs that you are often the only one who can think through end-to-end. You can look at these other jobs that you may or may not know exist, ex: product manager.

- Environment
Team, research philosophy, where you'll live. Talk with the team, and absolutely reach out and talk with other people who have worked with the team. 

## Other questions
1. What should students do to prepare before applying for internships?

2. How can students make their research compelling to fellowship and grant reviewers who might not be experts in their specific subject area?
Have non-experts read it, and see where they get lost!!! I had ~18 people read my NSF GRFP fellowship application drafts.

3. Who should students ask for letters of recommendation and how should they approach asking potential letter writers? 

4. What can students do to ensure they get the most out of an internship? Think about your goals: skills, or output.

5. How can internships be a launchpad for students into their next career stage?
