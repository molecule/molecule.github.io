I buy a TON of stuff on Amazon and I regularly write reviews. Mostly positive, but in the rare case where something is terrible, I go back and review that too.

I recently bought a screen protector specifically designed for the Pixel 2 XL. The product had some issues with their adhesive, but they offered to replace the defective screens for people who had the inferior versions, and I thought it was worth taking the risk to get a screen protector. It was easy to install and didn't interfere with my phone's functionality.

Unfortunately, about a month into using it, I dropped my phone and the screen protector popped off. When I went to re-attach it, 100% of the adhesive was gone and it no longer stuck to my phone screen. It was just a piece of glass. Now, when I went to review the product on Amazon, and tell people about my experience, I get this message:

First of all, what does "maintain the best possible shopping experience" mean, exactly? Maintain it for whom? Who is defining what counts as "best"? Baffled, I read through the [Customer Review Guidelines](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201929730).  

I'm certainly Eligible, since I've had an account for years and spent many thousands of dollars there:

I didn't even get to the part where I'd write a review, but it was going to be relevant, so seems like I'd be ok there:

In fact, the next several guidelines all relate to the content of the review which I hadn't even written yet. So why on earth would I be prevented
