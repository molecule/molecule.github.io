## Migraines (and what to do about them).

[Another article](https://www.hormonesmatter.com/migraine-all-wrong/) about migraines, indicating that it may be an inability for the brain to process massive glucose influx.

In migraine, peripheral skin temperature feedback (TEMP-FB), blood-volume-pulse feedback (BVP-FB) and electromyographic feedback (EMG-FB) are the most prominent applications, while electroencephalographic feedback (EEG-FB) and galvanic skin response training (GSR-FB) are seldom used. (Nestouric et al., 2008 [[1]])

Migraine patients treated with biofeedback will likely experience symptom improvements of 56â€“65% over and above those of an average patient in a waiting list control group. (Nestouric et al., 2008 [[1]])

Blood-volume-pulse feedback yielded higher effect sizes than peripheral skin temperature feedback and electromyography feedback. (Nestouric et al., 2007 [[2]])

#### Neurofeedback and biofeedback with 37 migraineurs: a clinical outcome study

37 migraine patients underwent an average of 40 neurofeedback sessions combined with thermal biofeedback. The study involved treatment using EEG biofeedback, pIR HEG biofeedback and handwarming biofeedback for an average total of 40 sessions. 30 minutes at least twice weekly. Results: Of the 37 migraine patients treated, 26 patients or 70% experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of their headaches which was sustained on average 14.5 months after treatments were discontinued. In neurofeedback, sensors are attached to the scalp and the raw EEG signal is amplified, the frequency spectrum is extracted via a Fourier transform and selected frequency components are displayed through a user interface such as a video game.

Assessment:
- Ten sites were collected: frontal (F3, FZ, F4), temporal T3, T4) central (C3, CZ and C4) and parietal areas (P3, P4) using the International 10-20 system of electrode placement.
- Data collected was used to determine peak amplitudes for specific frequencies within the 1-38 HZ range. 
- Data collection was performed at each site with the ground at FZ and with ipsilateral references and with the ground at C3 when sampling the FZ site. 
- Sampling rate was 256 samples per second using a third order filter and a 60 HZ notch filter. 
- Amplitude measures were peak to peak magnitude.

Protocols:
- One popular neurofeedback protocol for migraine emphasizes protocols rewarding 12-15 HZ at the temporal lobes at sites T3 and T4. (from training manual ref not available)
- Treatment: The EEG measures were used to guide neurofeedback training protocols by targeting frequency ranges with the highest amplitude. All migraine patients were trained to reduce the amplitude of the targeted frequencies. The EEG training primarily occurred at 5 sets of homologous sites - (T3-T4, C3-C4, F3-F4, FP1-FP2 and P3-P4). These homologous sites were chosen according to the lead author's training in neurofeedback in which years of clinical experience in treating migraines by other experienced clinicians is taught [22]. Electrode placements at homologous sites were used and training always began as a single channel placement using the first site as the signal and the second site as reference (example: T3-T4).
- When training each site, each client received positive feedback (visual and auditory rewards via a video type of game) whenever EEG activity exceeded certain amplitude thresholds within a target band (called the reward band). Training each homologous site rewards the difference between the amplitude at each site of the target frequency. Simultaneously, clients received no feedback whenever excessive high amplitude activity occurred in certain frequency bands (called the inhibit band) that had been identified during the assessment. This lack of auditory reward (no beep or feedback) is designed to discourage the client from making excessive activity in the inhibit band whenever this activity exceeds the set threshold.
- The reward and inhibit frequencies chosen for each site were also selected according to the individual's neurophysiological assessment and they were also based on a history of training recommendations considered to be optimal for migraine stabilization by the authors and other practitioners in the field (from training manual ref not available)
