## REVIEW GUIDES

There are TONS of incredible resources for writing rebuttals[1],  and excellent critiques of the peer review system[2],[3], but there are far fewer guides for writing helpful **reviews.** I've collected the few that I've found here!

- [Bjoern Hartmann has a thoughtful writeup.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/advice/reviewing.html)
- Ken Hinckley wrote [an absolute classic about the importance of looking for the merit in work, rather than trying to identify flaws.](http://mobilehci.acm.org/2015/download/ExcellenceInReviewsforHCICommunity.pdf)
- CHI has [an official guide that is sort of helpful.](https://chi2020.acm.org/guide-to-reviewing-papers/)
- Then there's the [Unofficial Guide to reviewing for HCI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpH3zV8WFU5avQHqrVTtxu-wNWzeTstxWy7K__HK5Nc/edit#heading=h.mq8hia60enm8), which is much more interesting but still not that helpful.

But what I always wanted was to see specific examples of high quality reviews, which I was never able to find. Well, as I found out accidentally, it turns out [I myself am an award-winning review writer!](https://twitter.com/FakePaperclips/status/1370131214430924803) To date, I have won 3 "special recognitions" for "outstanding reviews". Luckily for all of you, that means that I can share one of my award-winning reviews, since there are no rules against it[4], [5], [6], [7].

It seems the main danger is in revealing that I was the reviewer (breaking anonymity). I'm not concerned about this because I stand behind everything I wrote and this particular review is from several years ago. In fact I'd be completely comfortable with all of my reviews being public (but that's a separate conversation...)

## PROCESS
When writing a review, I first take extensive notes, including direct quotations from the paper itself. I let myself be really rude, arrogant, dismissive, OR bubbly and enthusiastic in these notes. I ask questions as they arise, and try to answer them with data and quotes from the paper itself. This is because good communication about the research is as important as the research itself, and an unclear or poorly structured paper is not going to get accepted, no matter how good the rest of "the research" is.

## AN AWARD-WINNING REVIEW

The author introduces two new methods, developed from an understanding of Object Theatre. The author describes an application of these methods during a design workshop for the creation of a booking system and health tracking system.

##### Positive aspects #####
Study design: 
The author conducted three workshops with designers, using the methods created by design experts and theatre practitioners. The methods would ultimately be used by designers, so this audience is well-motivated. Running three separate workshops iteratively is an excellent way to validate new techniques. The author also validated results in a studio workshop at a conference, and it’s unclear which of these studies the final results are from (clarifying this would be helpful).

Findings: 
The author shares some extremely compelling experiences from their participants. The embodied engagement with the laptop is particularly strong:  “It actually sounds worse, when there is a real person saying this.” This is a very interesting example of the “new relationship” with the objects that was one of the original goals of the author.

##### Negative aspects #####
Unclear definitions: 
“Object Theater” is a complex art form with a rich history, but it is not widely known by that name. By the end of the Introduction, the author still has not defined the term. The authors seem to be extremely familiar with all the nuances of the field: they shouldn’t let their expertise and familiarity impede understanding for other readers. In other words: the authors need to clearly state a definition, even if it doesn’t capture every different style of Object Theater. Defining which aspects of Object Theatre make it a particularly good fit for design research is also important. The author says Object Theatre “offers a set of methods” and provides “ways to work” but doesn’t clearly state what those methods are.

Unclear motivation: 
The paper would benefit from a really clear and concise problem statement. “The research group was curious to see what kind of new meanings things have and could take in the complex ecosystem of booking or tracking.” Curiosity is not a strong enough reason for studying a new method. Is the primary question: Whether a specific Object Theatre technique improves the design process using tangible objects? Or is it that the Internet of Things specifically requires a unique approach, one best informed by Object Theatre methods? Or, is it as the author writes near the end: to show “that concentration on ‘a thing’, collective imagery and object improvisation are the basic building blocks of object theater”? The first two arguments suggest a direct comparison with other brainstorming techniques, the last doesn’t seem appropriate for an HCI paper. The authors also need to clearly communicate how their work differs from other embodied, personified-object techniques like those mentioned in the Related Work. Clearly defining “Object Theatre” will go a long way towards helping with this. Relatedly, a great deal of creativity literature emphasizes the importance of openness, positivity, and “saying yes” to new ideas. In contrast, the Object Cemetery is all about identifying what doesn’t fit: further explanation of the reasoning for this new approach is important.

Unclear argument: 
The overall argument from the authors is not clear yet, and the authors have not quite articulated their goals and their findings in a compelling way. The Introduction is unclear and non-specific, making vague statements without helpful definitions. In contrast, the Discussion section includes many clear and compelling statements that better convey the authors’ goals: “The power of object theater is in exploring ‘real’ objects and manipulating the existing ideas that people have about them. To explore a general concept through object theater, the group needs to depart from the generic use of the object, to draw on aspects of e.g. materiality, sign, metaphor, history and symbolism.” Moving this to the Introduction and adding additional specific information on how Object Theatre techniques support this would clarify the authors’ stance. Similarly, “The intention of Talking Object method, however, is to start from our existing knowledge and investigate what we know about an object through the change of perspective” is a much more clear statement that articulates a vision and approach.

Muddy relationship with existing literature: 
The authors’ use of citations is not always clear. For example, they confusingly cite Jung et al.’s paper “Beauty and the Beast: An IoT Design Method Based on Improvisational Acting” as an example of “object theater practice”. It’s not clear how improvisational acting is related to object theatre (especially since the authors have not defined object theatre by this point in the paper). In Related Work, the authors describe a variety of other techniques, but they don’t contrast their own approach with these existing methods. Clearly articulating how this work differs from these existing practices can help clarify the contribution. For example, the authors describe Cila et al.’s Thing-Centered Narratives as enabling designers to “start to pay attention to the emotional relating between people and objects, and better understand how objects influence human life”. How does this differ from the author’s proposed approach? 

Unclear contribution: 
The authors describe their new method, Object Cemetery, as “based on Charlot Lemoine’s & Agnes Limbós’ [50] workshop exercise which aims at sensitizing actors to objects.” This framing doesn’t do the author’s contribution justice. Better phrasing can clarify that you’re introducing this classic object theatre approach to the world of HCI research. For example, a simple change would be: “The classic object theatre artist Charlot Lemoine and Ange Limbós created a workshop exercise that is used to sensitize actors to objects. Here, we adapt this for use with designers in a workshop focused on….” Even better would be a much more thorough explanation of this workshop style, how it is used by Object Theatre practitioners, the benefits for the actors, and then another paragraph that clearly articulates how those benefits should translate to designers. The authors can take this opportunity to identify what they see are the primary benefits of Object Theatre approaches and how those would improve the design of systems. 

The authors also need to take some time to discuss potential limitations of their method. For example, in the findings, the authors state that “[talking as an object from a first-person role] is not something people naturally do, so it took some time to get into the role.” How did the workshop facilitators help people do this? How was this challenge addressed (since it will surely be difficult for almost all design practitioners who don’t have experience performing)? Make sure the contribution helps future researchers recreate the work.

Findings not clear: 
The findings often seem to contradict themselves and also don’t always support the goals of the authors. For example, the authors say “digitalization drives the development of new design solutions in both [booking and health tracking] fields” but later say “Digital objects played a minor role” in the activities. Why should designers use a brainstorming technique that downplays or ignores the primary medium in which their work will be used? I think what the authors are trying to say is that by grounding design conversations in tangible objects, and embodying those objects through Object Theatre techniques, designers may develop a richer understanding of core ideas that will enhance and extend digital solutions. Taking the time to specifically clarify these goals will improve the paper. (By the way, the word is "digitized", not "digitalized").

Later in the findings section, the authors state that “Seeing the world from a perspective of an object challenged taken for-granted assumptions and made the participants to[sic] focus on unique characteristics of the object.” Restated, this makes for an excellent argument statement, but the findings don’t back this up. The authors emphasize that the techniques instead helped participants ‘narrow down’ to the ‘essential qualities’ of booking, which they identify as: “valid, digital, special and exceptional, culturally dependent and familiar.” Setting aside whether we all agree that these are the ‘essential qualities’ of booking systems, it’s unclear which of these aspects of booking are unique to the Object Cemetery methodology: no great insight seems to have taken place here. Comparing these findings with findings from another group using another technique would strengthen this paper. Additionally, the authors state that “There seemed to emerge a consensus to not design digital and obvious booking systems, but instead more imaginative and unpredictable booking objects”. So, why was ‘digital’ included in this list of ‘essential qualities’? And how does an unpredictable booking system serve the goals of ‘valid’ and ‘familiar’? Who would want an "unpredictable" booking system, anyway? These are just some examples of how the findings are communicated in a way that is contradictory and confusing.

The authors state that “The group wished to design wellbeing objects with a(sic) positive impact and usefulness to a person’s wellbeing, together with a natural and cozy appearance suitable for a person’s unique taste.” I value the importance of aesthetics a lot (search interfaces, aesthetic prosthetics, hospital gowns (https://www.bravegowns.com/), etc.) but this doesn’t sound like a deep insight.

##### Overall #####
While I appreciate the approach, and am always thrilled to see work that combines theatrical perspectives with technology and design, this paper in its current state is not ready for publication. I look forward to seeing a future version!
