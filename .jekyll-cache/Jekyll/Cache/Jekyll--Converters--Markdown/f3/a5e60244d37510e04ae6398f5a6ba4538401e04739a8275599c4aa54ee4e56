<p>â€œI took my 7 year old Granddaugher. From the moment is began, she never moved! We both enjoyed every moment of the play! I was such a wonderful way to kick-off our holiday season. We have both still been talking about it! Thank you so much!Excellent!

<p>â€œGrandkids and I loved the story and puppets; even with the people behind the scenes, the puppets were the main focus.â€ â€“ <a href="https://www.goldstar.com/events/berkeley-ca/emil-of-lonneberga?reviews=all#reviews">Goldstar review </a></p>

<p>â€œThis was a very sweet puppet show!â€ â€“ <a href="https://www.goldstar.com/events/berkeley-ca/emil-of-lonneberga?reviews=all#reviews">Goldstar review </a></p>

<p>â€œ[V]ery well done - the puppeteers that were very visible seemed invisible because they made the puppets so real looking.â€ â€“ <a href="https://www.goldstar.com/events/berkeley-ca/emil-of-lonneberga?reviews=all#reviews">Goldstar review </a></p>

<p>â€œVery clever &amp; fun! Adults may have even enjoyed it more than the kids, and I also LOVED the live musiciansâ€“really added that special touch to the performance!â€ â€“ <a href="https://www.goldstar.com/events/berkeley-ca/emil-of-lonneberga?reviews=all#reviews">Goldstar review </a></p>
