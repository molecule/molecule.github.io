## Visit St Louis
Definitely visit the City Museum! An epic, climbable indoor/outdoor jungle gym. There's no way it's safe. Be sure to buy kneepads.

Shaved Duck - I've eaten here many times, and was only disappointed on the most recent visit. Try it again. Burnt Ends are better than they sound. Skip the dense, dry cornbread.

Zoo - the zoo is free! Penguin exhibit and Sea Lion tunnel are particularly nice.

Museums - all the museums are free too! Too bad museums are boring.

Sugarfire - downtown, INCREDIBLE barbeque. 

Gooey Butter Cake - a local treat. Delicious and ridiculous.

The Arch - um, duh! It's GORGEOUS. The museum inside is free. Cool display of the top 5 finalists in the Arch design competition so you can see what the other proposals were.

## Visit Kansas City, Missouri
JackStack is THE BEST BBQ in town. Highly recommend the corn, beans, and burnt ends.


## Tips for living abroad
When you live in a foreign country, you have two choices: you can keep your current name, and learn to live with the painful experience of every person you meet mispronouncing your name, or you can choose a name from the local culture and learn to respond to a new set of phonemes. 

When I lived in the Czech Republic, I kept my American name, "Molly". Pronounced properly in Czech, it means "small" or "moths". Pronounced the way it's spelled, it sounds like "Mow-leh". No one wanted to refer to me as "moths", so I had to get used to people misprouncing my name all day, every day. It seems like a small thing, but it was rage-inducing. (Side note: if you live in a diverse place, learn to pronounce people's names correctly: it's worth it to put in the effort). 

When I lived in Bangladesh, people would visibly flinch when I introduced myself. Eventually, we got someone to tell us that my name translates to "gardener". Having just finally escaped the horrors of "mow-leh" in the Czech Republic, I decided to embrace a new name and chose "Jhorna" on the recommendation of one of my coworkers (it means "waterfall" or maybe "fountain"). It was tricky learning to respond to this new set of sounds, but now I treasure the name: it reminds me instantly of that place and culture. Plus, people appreciated that I liked the culture enough to choose an appropriate name. I'll always choose a new name when visiting a new place now!
