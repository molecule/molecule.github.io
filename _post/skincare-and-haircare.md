### Way more details than you ever wanted
#### Sunscreen

Most folks know that [dermatologists say the #1 thing you can do for anti-aging is wear sunscreen](https://sciencebecomesher.com/science-based-anti-aging-the-no-1-product-you-need/)! Unfortunately most Western sunscreens available in the U.S. are extremely terrible. They're thick, greasy, difficult to spread, and can leave a major "white cast" to your face. What's more, the FDA has very loose requirements on reporting sunscreen effectiveness, and has been slow to approve new UV filters. Japanese and Korean sunscreens, however, are light-years beyond these pitiful FDA-approved options. 

First, some quick info about the different kinds of damaging sun rays:
- UVB (B is for BURNING): causes sunburns and skin cancer.
- UVA (A is for AGING): causes wrinkles, tanning, hyperpigmentation, sun spots.

You need protection from both in order to have healthy skin! Remember that windows don't protect against all UV rays. Check out this amazing picture of a truck driver, and see if you can tell which side of his face was exposed to the sun through a window as he drove his truck for 28 years:

In the U.S., sunscreen manufacturers are required to report the SPF protection provided by their sunscreen. SPF stands for sun protection factor. It measures a sunscreen's amount of protection from UVB rays. PPD, on the other hand, stands for persistent pigment darkening. It's tested by applying a product to human skin and measuring how long it takes for the skin to darken (i.e. tan) compared to bare skin. Let's say it takes 10 minutes for bare skin to start to tan. If a product was applied and it took instead 160 minutes (2 hours 40 minutes) for the skin to tan, then the product has a PPD of 16, because it took 16 times longer for skin to darken as it normally would have. 

- PA+ = PPD 2-4
- PA++ = PPD 4-8
- PA+++ = PPD 8 to 16
- PA++++ = PPD 16 to 35

Remember, UVA rays are the ones responsible for aging and UVB rays are the ones responsible for burning. In the U.S., [sunscreens are only required to report whether they are "broad spectrum"](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=0089115bdbc8686f591ab359c37abea0&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&n=pt21.5.352&r=PART#se21.5.352_173), not any PPD value. Unfortunately, even if a sunscreen claims "broad spectrum", you just don't know how much UVA protection it has. For example, many sunscreens use *avobenzone* for UVA protection, which degrades incredibly quickly in sunlight. [Avobenzone loses 50% of it's UV protective property in less than an hour](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06173.x). Several hours later you are nearly completely vulnerable to UVA if your sunscreen doesn't contain other UVA filters or Avobenzone stabilizers, like Tinosorb and Octisalate.

Asian sunscreens have much better filters and formulations. Not only do the sun filtering ingredients used in Asian sunscreens degrade less quickly than those in American suncreens, but they are far more cosmetically elegant. They sink in almost instantly, glide on smoothly, dry to a dewy or matte finish (as you prefer), AND the level of sun protection is *significantly* higher. All the sunscreens I recommend are minimum SPF 50 and PA++++.

This is my absolute, hands-down all-time favorite sunscreen:

There's a reason Can Make is the favorite sunscreen of every single person who has ever tried it. It is better than any sunscreen has a right to be. It's like a gel moisturizer that just disappears into your skin. It's a joy to apply: it's not drying, it's not greasy, it's absolutely perfect.
