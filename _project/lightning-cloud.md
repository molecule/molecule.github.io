This is the first step towards creating a little ambient weather indicator. This is the "ambient" part: it's [a little cloud that lights up as though it is filled with lightning][dark-video]. After reading [Stephen Anderson’s “Seductive Interaction Design“][seductive], I was inspired to create a “glanceable” weather indicator. [Richard Clarkson’s work on “The Cloud”][clarkson] is beautiful, but not as functional as what I was interested in creating. This project introduced me to the challenges of distilling information down into a “glanceable” format. How do I create a system where users can select the ranges they are interested in, and make a cloud that displays the information they are interested in?


I also wrote an [Instructable for how to control the lightning cloud (or any Arduino project!) via Bluetooth.][bluetooth]
