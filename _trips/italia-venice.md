It has that classic old European twisty, windy road feel, and it's absolutely wild to walk around in. My favourite thing about visiting such a unique place for such a long time (we were there for over a week) was slowly learning all the neighborhoods, and an area that I struggled to find the first day was a comfortable, easy landmark later in the trip.
