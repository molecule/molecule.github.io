I"v<p>The two professors who examined me for my Prelim test have graciously given consent for me to post their detailed notes from the actual exam here. I’m sharing it here in the interest of supporting future students in the program and for documenting my own experience. As you can see, their expectations are clearly spelled out. Professor Paulos has also provided <a href="http://www.paulos.net/teaching/prelims/Eric_Paulos_Prelim_Fall_2017_Questions.pdf">a more complete copy of all of his planned questions here.</a></p>

<p>Professor Canny requested that I remove all the parts of the document that capture my responses. He was concerned that students preparing for the exam would read too much into it. I can see his point, and encourage interested students to contact me directly (or any upper-level graduate student) to discuss how the test actually unfolds. You can also read <a href="https://molecule.github.io/post/prelims%20from%20my%20perspective/">my post about the test from my perspective</a> to get a sense of how it went.</p>

<h4 id="q1-multitouch">Q1. Multitouch</h4>
<p>SCORE: 7/10</p>

<p>Good high-level description of FTIR
good discussion of some advantages
didn’t mention hover
did discuss sensitivities to moisture etc</p>

<p>Immediately recalled term FTIR and drew sketch.</p>

<p>Recalled need for camera away from screen</p>

<p>Incorrectly said individual people could be identified as well as some speculation (incorrect) that individual hands/finger could be identified (did propose heuristic of handiness that could be used).  Also that objects and stylus could be detected.</p>

<p>Returned to drawing but internal reflection was still not draw correctly … did not draw internal reflection as part of sketch but but did have projector behind with camera</p>

<p>STEVEN P. DOW, ALANA GLASSCO, JONATHAN KASS, MELISSA SCHWARZ, DANIEL L. SCHWARTZ, and SCOTT R. KLEMMER, 2010
SCORE: 8/10</p>

<p>Summarize High-Level results of this paper?</p>

<p>Parallel Prototyping during design of a web banner ad leads to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher click-through</li>
  <li>Higher expert evaluation</li>
  <li>More diversity (Mech Turk study)</li>
  <li>High self-efficacy as measure by pre- and post-surveys of subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is parallel prototyping? 
A process whereby designers produced prototypes in batches (two in this study consisting of 3 then 2 prototypes respectively)
vs a traditional method of sequential design and feedback on prototypes one-at-a-time (control condition).</p>

<p>What were the high-level findings of the study?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parallel prototypes received significantly higher clickthrough than sequential</li>
  <li>Parallel prototypes received significantly higher expert ratings than sequential</li>
  <li>Parallel prototypes received significantly higher diversity ratings (by M. turkers) than sequential</li>
  <li>Parallel prototypes designers realized a significant increase in self-efficacy vs sequential designers who did not</li>
</ul>

<p>What theoretical rationale did the authors gives for these findings?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clickthrough/expert scores: Evidence from the literature than comparison with other options improves design choices. The parallel
design strongly encourages comparison during design.</li>
  <li>Diversity: Deferred feedback encourages diversity, repeated criticism can cause narrowing of design choices.</li>
  <li>Self-efficacy: Less (rounds of) critique improves self-efficacy, critique of multiple designs helps designers attach the criticism
to the prototypes and not to themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Were there any obvious weaknesses in the study?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimenter chose critqiques of prototypes (probably not blind, since
experimenter would have known conditions that designers were in). There
is strong potential for bias here, since experimenter has an incentive
to favor parallel condition designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mean and standard deviations of viewing time for the two cases were:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Parallel          Sequential
31(143)            13(80)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Sketch possible distributions for those times (What qualitative shape did they have)? 
The experimenters used a t-test for this comparison. Was that a sound choice?</p>

<h4 id="q3beyond-being-there">Q3:Beyond Being There</h4>
<p>SCORE: 7/10</p>

<p>Correctly recognized core idea of BBT paper. Listed by name Anonymity, semi-synchronous (Asynchronous), Archive, and Clarity…we did not hear about Feedback directly</p>

<p>Was able to describe the mechanism to focus on the communication part rather than the distance … struggled with actual term but identified the concept describing it as social presence (and a few others). Articulated nice story from paper story about improved phone audio quality actually removed sense of distance which problematic.</p>

<h4 id="q4-creativity-support-tools-ben-schneiderman-2002-cacm">Q4. Creativity Support Tools, BEN SCHNEIDERMAN, 2002 CACM.</h4>
<p>SCORE: 8/10</p>

<p>Recall the 4 activities in the author’s framework for creativity?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect</li>
  <li>Relate</li>
  <li>Create</li>
  <li>Donate</li>
</ul>

<p>The author then included an example of family history generation
comprising photo annotation, comments from family, and then collation
and editing of the comments into a web site. What tools potentially
support this kind of activity today?</p>

<p>The authors rationale and examples led him to construct a longer list of tasks
for creativity (dont need to recall this):</p>

<p>1) Search
2) Visualize data or processes
3) Consult peers
4) Think (ideate)
5) Explore
6) Compose artifacts
7) Review/replay
8) Disseminate results</p>

<p>I’d like you to express your critical reactions to these choices. This is an open-ended question. Examples of reactions are:
contrast with what was expressed in this paper in 2002 and what has happened since? What design choices in the paper were
justified by argument and what were more arbitrary? What choices might reflect the author’s personal biases?</p>

<p>Criteria for evaluating responses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Volume of reactions</li>
  <li>Quality of reactions: e.g. grounding in theory or experiments, logical inference leading to conclusions</li>
  <li>Diversity of reactions</li>
  <li>Relations found to other topics in HCI</li>
  <li>Recognition of opportunities for further research</li>
</ul>
