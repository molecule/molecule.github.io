When you live in a foreign country, you have two choices: you can keep your current name, and learn to live with the painful experience of every person you meet mispronouncing your name, or you can choose a name from the local culture and learn to respond to a new set of phonemes. 

When I lived in the Czech Republic, I kept my American name, "Molly". Pronounced properly in Czech, it means "small" or "moths". Pronounced the way it's spelled, it sounds like "Mow-leh". No one wanted to refer to me as "moths", so I had to get used to people misprouncing my name all day, every day. It seems like a small thing, but it was rage-inducing. (Side note: if you live in a diverse place, learn to pronounce people's names correctly: it's worth it to put in the effort). 

When I lived in Bangladesh, people would visibly flinch when I introduced myself. Eventually, we got someone to tell us that my name translates to "gardener". Having just finally escaped the horrors of "mow-leh" in the Czech Republic, I decided to embrace a new name and chose "Jhorna" on the recommendation of one of my coworkers (it means "waterfall"). It was tricky learning to respond to this new set of sounds, but now I treasure the name: it reminds me instantly of that place and culture. Plus, people appreciated that I liked the culture enough to choose an appropriate name. I'll always choose a new name when visiting a new place now!
