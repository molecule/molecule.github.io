        desc:  Through interviews with expert practitioners in diverse domains including performance, craft, engi- neering, and design, we identify four strategies for managing aspects of the creative process, including  metacognition, emotional affect, task motivation, and working style. These strategies are 1) Strategic Forgetting, 2) Mode Switching, 3) Embodying Process, and 4) Aestheticizing.

        video:
        desc: An exploration of version control tools and history information management in creative practices. We identify four key considerations for version control in creative work. 1) using versions as a palette of materials, 2) providing confidence and freedom to explore, 3) leveraging low-fidelity version capture, and 4) reflecting on and reusing versions across long time scales. We discuss how these themes can provide insight into future designs and uses of version control systems.

        video:
        desc: Introduces Friendscope, an instant, in-the-moment experience sharing system for lightweight commercial camera glasses. Friendscope explores the concept of a shared camera which allows a wearer to share control of their camera with a remote friend, making it possible for both people to capture photos/videos from the camera in the moment. Through a user study with 48 participants, we found that users felt connected to each other, describing the shared camera as a more intimate form of livestreaming.

        desc: Introduces AirConstellations, which allows us to explore the potential of dynamic in-air device formations for the next generation of multi-device workspace setups in a variety of use-cases. Our application scenarios showcase the potential of such highly dynamic workspace confgurations, with spatially-aware behaviors, feedforward, and other interaction techniques.

        video: https://youtu.be/_P6WKr2dzXE
        desc: We describe the 4-month co-design process with expert theatre practitioners, and detail how this process resulted in the design of technology-mediated experiences outside the temporal and spatial confines of a live theatre production. In the style of research through design, we present three annotated prototypes; 1) the Augmented Playbill, 2) the Prayer Wheel, and 3) Tarot Cards as well as accompanying AR applications to convey the decisions we made and the philosophy we iteratively developed throughout the project.

        desc: Presents a creative workstation for supporting a ``conversational'' creative working style by bringing a stronger physicality to computational sensor signals and balance the conversation between physical and digital actors. Through a formal user study, we characterize the actuation design practice supported by the CwM workstation and discuss opportunities for tangible interfaces to hybrid materials.

        video: 
        desc: Outlines the design space of "guardians", or elements of a creative practice that mitigate the psychological effects of failure to create cultures of resiliency and perseverance. Through contextual inquiry, we contribute an inventory of failure-mitigation strategies from a variety of creative disciplines. We synthesize guidelines for the design of new guardians and present a preliminary exploration of guardians for lasercutting.

        desc: We present AlterWear, an architecture for new wearable devices that implement a batteryless design using electromagnetic induction via NFC and bistable e-ink displays. This unique combination of hardware enables both quick, dynamic and long-term interactions with persistent visual displays. We demonstrate new wearables enabled by AlterWear, and evaluate them in a user study.

        desc: Presents an exploration and working prototype of hair as a site for novel interaction, leveraging hair's position as something both public and private, social and personal, malleable and permanent. We develop applications and interactions around this new material in HäirIÖ, a novel hair-based technology that combines capacitive touch input and dynamic output through color and shape change.
