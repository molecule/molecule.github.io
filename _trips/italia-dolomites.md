description: Three weeks in Italy. Venice, hut-to-hut hiking in the Dolomites, Pompeii, the Amalfi Coast, and Rome.

## Dolomites

#### Getting there and away
- Rome2Rio is a fantastic site for searching for transportation. It shows lots of different options, prices, schedules, etc. HOWEVER - one thing I learned is that some of the buses (and maybe trains?) are seasonal. For example, Rome2Rio shows a daily bus that leaves from Venice to Listolade (a teeny town in the Dolomites), but it turns out it only runs from July-August! I found this out only by emailing the bus company. Luckily there are other options, but this was a pretty big surprise when I discovered it initially. Additionally, if two legs of a trip are on the same TYPE of conveyance (i.e., both buses), then Rome2Rio shows them both as the same colour, making it hard to notice that there's a transfer. This kinda bit us in the booty when we were coming back from the Dolomites, because our bus that we THOUGHT would take us in to Venice proper actually dumped us at the airport, where we needed to transfer to another bus to get to the island.
- In general it was quite difficult to figure out which parts of the "AV1" were accessible by car, and which weren't. We didn't want to follow the traditional/recommended route, so I needed to figure out how to get us into / out of the mountains. This took a LOT of time and effort, so if you don't want to spend weeks figuring this out, I highly recommend just booking with a group.
- I also wanted "bail out options" everywhere along the route, which was also super tricky to find.
- It was very difficult to figure out the actual distances between rifugios. The most popular hiking book () really sucks for this: instead of a map with distances on it, it shows TIMES between a random subset of rifugios. WHY?? Instead, I recommend the app OutdoorActive - this will let you put in two locations, and it'll automatically calculate the distance (including altitude change) between two points. While it wasn't perfect (more on that later) this was by far the most helpful planning app I found.

### Route
We did an atypical route: we went South to North. When I was researching the trip, it seemed like the altitude gain was the same no matter which direction you went. 

#### Day 0: Venice --> Rif. Vazzoler

We took a train from Venice to Belluno (9 Euros each, 2 hrs), then caught a taxi from Belluno to Rifugio Capanna Trieste (120 Euros, 45 minutes). Then we walked from Rif. Trieste to Rif. Vazzoler (4km, very steep). It rained almost the whole walk. We arrived at Rif. Vazzoler at about 8pm. The food was excellent: life-changingly delicious barley soup.

#### Day 1: Rif. Vazzoler --> Rif. Coldai

We started hiking at around TK AM - we were the last ones out of the Rifugio. This was the most intense hiking we did the whole trip. I'm still recovering from several years of deconditioning due to my chronic illness, but WOW was this tough. I didn't take many pictures on this leg because honestly I was absolutely wiped out.

That last picture was maybe halfway up the longest uphill part of the climb. I really truly wasn't sure if I was going to make it. The hiking app kept telling us we only had 45 minutes left - it took us 2 hours from this point to make it to the rifugio. We passed a lake but I was afraid to stop and appreciate it - I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep walking.

#### Day 2: Rif. Coldai --> Rif. Staulanza --> Passo Giau
