<ul>
  <li>2.5 pounds of cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/3 Cup sugar</li>
  <li>1/3 Cup sour cream</li>
  <li>1/3 Cup heavy whipping cream</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoons lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
  <li>6 large whole eggs</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix heavy whipping cream into cream cheese.</li>
  <li>Mix salt and half of sugar into cream cheese.</li>
  <li>Mix in remaining sugar, beat for at least a minute.</li>
  <li>Add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix for another minute.</li>
  <li>Add yolks and mix for a minute.</li>
  <li>Add remaining eggs, two at a time, mixing between eggs.</li>
  <li>Bake at 500 for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t open oven door, and turn oven temperature down to 200.</li>
  <li>Bake for another hour, maybe an hour and a half. Itâ€™s done when a circle the size of a penny in the center jiggles a bit and nothing else does. The center should also measure 150 degrees.</li>
  <li>Cool for 1.5-2 hours.</li>
  <li>Put in fridge for at least 6 hours.</li>
</ol>
