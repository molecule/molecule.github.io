3. Scoop little teaspoon-size chunks onto a plate and place in freezer for 10 minutes.
4. Place the little scoopy chunks into a tupperware in the fridge.

Based on [this recipe from wholenaturallife.com](http://wholenaturallife.com/cinnamon-butter-bites-gaps-friendly/), but I hate how it takes like 2 minutes to scroll down to the recipe so I'm duplicating it here.
