<p>A wind-activated paint spinner to visualize air power released from an air vent on UC Berkeley campus.</p>

<p>This project was created as part of the Critical Making course at UC Berkeley. For this project, we first identified and explored a location on campus, then developed an installation to share our discoveries with the world. We were fascinated by the powerful air coming out of the vent, and wanted to capture its playful character.</p>

<p>Beyond the original intent, I was interested in how this project drew people in. We set it up in the Critical Making booth at Maker Faire, and found that many people were interested in interacting with it. There wasnâ€™t much to be learned from the interaction experience â€“ but itâ€™s important to capture the ability of this device to spark interest.</p>
