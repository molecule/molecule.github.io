# PSA: Sensitive, "reactive" skin? Visit an allergist!

My entire life I've had sensitive skin. Since I was a kid, I'd break out in hives all over my body several times a year. It happened so often that it became completely normal to me, and I just accepted it. I can't wear any clothing more than 12 hours or I'll get hives where the clothing touches my skin. I can't use most bandaids for more than a day without getting a rash and a dark mark that lasts for weeks.  I also learned to be very careful about what I'd put on my face since I'd randomly have really strong negative reactions. Sometimes this meant acne and breakouts (the fastest was a massive pimple exactly where I'd patch-tested a product a mere 6 hours later), and sometimes this meant [swelling, redness, itching, flaking, peeling nightmare skin](https://photos.app.goo.gl/heh6D9SsfmaxibfT7). 

All the pictures of my face in that album are from one horrible week in 2016 where my face absolutely exploded. Why? I still don't really know. I'd only been using products I was familiar with and had been using regularly for months, nothing new for at least 6 months, only gentle products (Neutrogena makeup remover wipes, CeraVe moisturizer in the tub, Elta MD sunscreen). After 6 hours of trying to power through the extreme itching and pain, I ended up leaving work early and going to an urgent care clinic where I was referred for an emergency dermatologist appointment. They immediately sent me to the large hospital in the area, where I was prescribed level 10 steroids. These are very strong and must be used carefully, but they provided immediate relief. It took about a week, but finally my skin calmed down.

Fast forward to earlier this summer, when I was prescribed mupirocin for a staph infection on my ears. Applications burned and stung like the fire of a thousand bees. I immediately discontinued and told my doctor, who said she'd never heard of anyone having a bad reaction and told me to keep applying. A week later I went back for my follow-up where they realized I'm extremely allergic to mupirocin. I told the doctor these kinds of extreme reactions were pretty common for me, and she referred me to an allergist.

This has turned out to be fantastic for my skin and quality of life in general! I'm so glad I went and I'm so so sad I didn't do it earlier. It wouldn't have caught the mupirocin (that's not a common allergy so there's no test for it), but my skin is so much happier now that I know what irritating ingredients to avoid, and what an allergic reaction even looks like!

## Here's how my allergy test worked:

The allergist did a patch test of many common allergies. This involves sticking 3 labeled patches to my back. I also had to stop taking my daily antihistamine which was much more uncomfortable than I thought it would be. She warned me the test might leave scars, especially if my skin ends up reacting to them. She explained that if spots itch, I should carefully remove that square and keep it so we know what I'm allergic to. I had to wear the patches for 4 days straight and avoid getting them wet (so no showers and no sweat-inducing activities like exercise). On the 4th day I went back and she pulled them off to look for reactions.

I reacted to 3 ingredients (and the tape - I'm often allergic to bandaids, sports tape, or other adhesives). The allergist listed them out for me:

- Patch #1 - Nickel. A metal. Very common allergy. Means I can't wear cheap/costume jewellery, only sterling silver, gold, platinum, etc.
- Patch #23 Thimerasol. Something that used to be common in eye drops but has mostly been discontinued since so many people are allergic to it.
- Patch #29: Imidazolidanyl Urea (formaldehyde-releasing preservative). This was my strongest reaction and is an ingredient commonly found in skincare and cosmetics.

The allergist also said I probably didn't find the ingredient when I was tracking my reactions since the reaction can take 2-3 days to show up, and might not actually happen when I apply THAT product, but only when I apply something ELSE. My mind was blown! This explained why my skin would break out in hives/redness/itching "randomly", and why it always seemed to be reacting to something. She also said I have dermatographic urticaria, which basically means my skin reacts with hives in reaction to pressure. This is why I can't wear fitted clothing (like socks, bras, pants, underwear, etc) for more than 12 hours without irritation.

I immediately went home and searched through my current skincare to see if I was using anything that had any of those ingredients. LOW AND BEHOLD: My beloved Stratia Liquid Gold!!!! I was so devastated. And confused...it's never caused problems. It's never burned or itched. In fact it's my go-to when my skin is in need of some extra TLC. I use it almost daily. It couldn't possibly be the source of problems, right? Maybe they mis-read my patch test? But I set it aside, and thought I'd try not using it for at least a month to see what would happen.

WELL.

It's a month later and I've completely avoided everything I'm allergic to and GUESS WHAT. Not only does my skin not burn or sting even a teeny bit when I apply my other skincare products, but my acne is better, my redness is almost gone, and my skin just feels so much less irritated! So while I'm sad to discontinue Stratia Liquid Gold, ultimately I think it's best for me to not use it. I'm also an expert at reading ingredient labels now, and it's actually really easy to avoid these, even though it's a common ingredient.

## Who should see an allergist:

- Anyone who identifies as having 'sensitive' or 'reactive' skin.
- Anyone who has tried tracking skincare ingredients with no success
- Anyone who has a history of hives or sudden, extreme skin reactions.

If you fit any of the above, I really really recommend seeing an allergist if you can!
