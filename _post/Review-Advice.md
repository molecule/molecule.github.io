## REVIEW GUIDES
There are TONS of incredible resources for writing rebuttals[[1]],  and excellent critiques of the peer review system[[2]],[[3]], but there are far fewer guides for writing helpful **reviews.** I've collected the few that I've found here!

- [Bjoern Hartmann has a thoughtful writeup.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/advice/reviewing.html)
- Ken Hinckley wrote [an absolute classic about the importance of looking for the merit in work, rather than trying to identify flaws.](http://mobilehci.acm.org/2015/download/ExcellenceInReviewsforHCICommunity.pdf)
- Dan Cosley wrote [an excellent and thorough blog about the reviewing process](https://blogs.cornell.edu/danco/2014/06/12/how-i-review-papers/).
- [Another one from Rice Lab](https://ricelab.github.io/blog/2018/writing-reviews-for-hci/)
- Max Wilson [wrote one a very brief blog post, as part of a class for the COVID-cancelled CHI 2020](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszmw/peer-review-course/).
- And then there's [an extended abstract about reviewing.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3027063.3027097)
- CHI has [an official guide that is sort of helpful.](https://chi2020.acm.org/guide-to-reviewing-papers/)
- Then there's the [Unofficial Guide to reviewing for HCI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpH3zV8WFU5avQHqrVTtxu-wNWzeTstxWy7K__HK5Nc/edit#heading=h.mq8hia60enm8), which is much more interesting but still not that helpful.

But what I always wanted was to see specific, concrete, actual examples of high quality reviews, which I was never able to find. Well, as I found out accidentally, it turns out that [I myself am an award-winning review writer!](https://twitter.com/FakePaperclips/status/1370131214430924803) To date, I have won 3 "special recognitions" for "outstanding reviews". I'm working on anonymizing those to post them here soon!!
