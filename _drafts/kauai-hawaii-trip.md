## Ultimate Hawai'i Packing List
We looked at quite a few packing lists before we went to Hawai'i. None of them mentioned what we found to be the most important things:

### 1. Microfiber towel. 

Forget traditional terry cloth towels. They're bulky, heavy, they take forever to dry, and they easily get full of sand. Microfiber towels are compact, absorb tons of water, dry in only a few hours, and brush clean of sand with a quick shake.

### 2. Waterproof case for your phone.

This was surprisingly difficult to get on the island. Most grocery stores and pharmacies sold a cheap waterproof bag style phone case that had zero reviews on Amazon. I prefer tried-and-true, so we bought a GoBag from Paddle and Pedal for around $30. I took this everywhere we went snorkeling and got some excellent underwater pictures and video. 

**Cons**: 
- Can capture weird reflections and distortions esp when above water.
- Touching the screen doesn't work underwater. This can make switching into video mode difficult as you have to lift the case out of the water to touch the button. Taking pictures can be done w/ the volume buttons. I set my phone to auto-open the camera when I doubletap the power button. On average it would take me about 1.5 seconds to go from seeing something cool to taking a picture of it. For snorkeling, it was easy to get into video mode since you're nearly always right on the surface of the water.
- You can get phantom touches on the screen, which would randomly trigger various phone functions. This was resolved if I made sure the bag was full of air before going into the water, since then the waterproof bag is held off the surface of the phone by the air and nothing can cause phantom touches on the phone.
- Phone can have trouble focusing. I'm not sure if this was entirely the bag's fault, or if it's more related to the poor visibility we had in Hawai'i. It would sometimes get unfocused. I couldn't touch the screen to refocus, and also couldn't always even see that it was unfocused.

**Pros**:
- Most images turn out really clear. Videos in particular worked really well. I'm thrilled with the underwater stuff I got: the turtles and the dolphins really blew my mind.
- Phone was completely safe and dry the whole time.
- Strap felt fairly secure, certainly good enough for snorkeling. I also had a climbing strap and a caribiner to give me more room but also more security for keeping it attached to my body.
- The air inside the bag means it floats, even w/ my heavy Pixel 2 XL.

### Ziplock bags
The humidity, beach sand and beach water will get in everything: it was convenient to have little bags you could throw your wallet, rental car keys and whatever else into a little waterproof bag.

## Activities

### Hiking
We went on quite a few hikes: Sleeping Giant, Okolehao, and the Awa'awapuhi hike to see the NaPali coast. By far my favourite was the [Awa'awapuhi trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/hawaii/awaawapuhi-trail): the view at the end is spectacular. 

#### Awa'awapuhi Hike
Don't miss this. The view is the best on the island. It can get slippery and muddy. You can check trail conditions before heading out but we didn't. The most dangerous part of the hike is out at the end, but it's in direct sunlight so if it's been sunny it'll likely be dry. It is illegal and very dangerous to go past the guard-rails. But nearly everyone does and as long as you don't die it's totally worth it. The hike down is fairly easy: it was pretty muddy the day we did it, but not as bad as Okolehao, so we barely noticed it. We nearly ran the second half of the trail. Going up was much more arduous. You gain ~2,000 feet in altitude over 3.1 miles, so it's a steady, unrelenting hike up to your car, which can get a little tiring. 

#### Okolehao
We didn't go up very far. I've heard the view is spectacular. We preferred to snorkel since we can hike in California already :)

#### Sleeping Giant
This hike was pretty easy and has a great view at the top. 

#### Pihea Ridge trail Alaka'i Swamp Trail

#### Kauapea (Secrets) Beach
This was a surprise hike. It's quite a walk down to the beach off the dirt road. If you get down to the beach and then realize you need to go to the bathroom, it'll take you around 45 minutes to make it back to the beach. No facilities. Gorgeous beach, but rough surf means it's not great for swimming or snorkeling.

#### Recommended hikes
We didn't have time to do these, but had them recommended by locals while we were there:
- [Kalepa Ridge Trail.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/hawaii/kalepa-ridge-trail) At the end of 0.8 miles you have a view of Kalalau valley on one side, and Honopu beach on the other. Sounds perfect.

### Camping
County site for Kaua'i: https://www.kauai.gov/Camping
State parks: https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,e-search.html

#### Salt Pond Park
A small park right on the beach. You'll sleep less than 50 feet from crashing waves in a beautiful little harbor. All the tents were clustered at one end of the park because "the druggies" and the Hawaiian Independentists had claimed the other end. There were so many hikers/backpackers/tourists camping that it felt safe: safety in numbers. There's a large streetlight in the middle of the camping area, so bring something to cover your eyes at night. The roosters parade around all night, showing off their vocal chords, so earplugs may also be a good idea. The park ranger comes by to check permits early in the morning (6am), and some people left before that. Permits are $3 per person per night, and we were very happy to support the Hawaiian park system.

#### Lucy Wright Park
Literally right next to the highway. We didn't stay here but it didn't look great. It was not recommended by the lady who sold us our park permits.

#### Polihale State Park
The road to get out to the beach is not paved. We were there a month after a huge rainstorm, so they had recently "re-graded" the road so it was flat and covered with large rocks. We went slow in our Toyota caravan, and were passed by many lifted SUVs and 4x4 trucks. There were also a bunch of small passenger cars out there, so it's doable, at least as of May 2018. We turned left at the monkeypod tree to head to the Queen's Pond area. There are two roads: the one on the right is very pitted and filled with potholes. The one on the left is nearly flat. They both go to the same place. We parked by the side of the road and threw up our tent on a hill overlooking the ocean.

### Snorkeling

We rented gear at [Snorkel Bob's](http://www.snorkelbob.com/) and Nukumoi surf shop. Snorkel Bob's was a weekly rate of $45 for a complete set (snorkel, mask, fins) plus a wetsuit shirt (an additional $50). Nukumoi was $12 for a week of just a mask and snorkel. The Nukumoi mask was wayyyyyyy better than the stuff from Snorkel Bob's. The snorkels were the same. The defogger stuff from Nukumoi was also way more effective.

- Mask
    - Make sure the mask fits snugly w/ no leaks. Ideally you'll test it by putting your face in a swimming pool or bucket of water. Go back to the shop if you're having issues and they'll fix you up with stuff that works. 
    - A mask should not fog up at all. If it's foggy, go back to the shop and get a new one. The de-fogger stuff works as long as the mask is in ok condition. My mask is nearly 20 years old and never fogs up. It just depends on how well it's treated.
- Fins 
    - Fins should feel really snug: your heels should not lift out when you stand up and go on your tippy-toe. 
    - It's worth it to get the fast ones :)
- Snorkel
    - Make sure your snorkel is on the correct side for how it's built. 
    - Personally I don't think the fancy snorkel is worth it. Even the "old" snorkels now prevent water from going in, and are easy to clear of any water w/ their one-way vents, so they are plenty good and you can save money here.
- Wetsuit
    - A wetsuit should be incredibly, almost painfully tight. Any water that gets in will make it not work. Minimize gaps in the arms or neckhole. 
    - Remember it'll get looser when it gets wet and you don't want it to be too loose.
    - The water in Hawai'i is warm, but if you're prone to getting cold or just want to be out snorkeling as long as possible, I'd recommend it. You can also buy a nice wetsuit for $160 which is probably worth it if you'll go on any other snorkeling trips in your life.

#### First-time snorkeling tips
1. Practice putting your fins on while sitting on land. It's usually easier to put them on in the water, but make sure you can quickly slip them onto your feet in 3 seconds or less. If it takes you more time than that, keep practicing. You'll want to be able to quickly slip them on and swim past the wave break. If it's really hard for you, putting them on on land and walking backwards into the ocean might be best.
2. Practice breathing with your mask and snorkel on land. Then, stand in the water and put your face under. Keep your eyes open and your nose blocked (pretend like you have a stuffy nose: there should be no air coming in or out of your nose or it'll get foggy and be prone to leakage). Practice breathing slowly and evenly through only your mouth. It can feel weird to breathe through a snorkel for the first time,  This should also double as a leak-check for your mask.
    1. Your mask should fit very snugly with no leaking. If it passes the suction test and it's still leaking it is either defective, really wrong for your face, or it's not tight enough. By the end of 1 hour of snorkeling you should have a clear indentation of where your mask is: it should be very tight but not giving you a headache or pinching or painful. Just very snug.
2. Fins
    1. Swimming with fins is a different mindset from being in the water without fins. As soon as you have fins on, you no longer have legs: you have fins. You cannot stand on fins, you cannot walk on fins: you should be swimming at all times. If you need to stand up, no you don't. If you need to rest, flip over and float on your back. Your fins should be horizontal to the ocean floor at all times. When you're ready to have legs again, swim to a shallow spot and take them off.
    2. If you really need to stand up, first flip over so you're on your back, then bring your legs to the ocean floor heel first. If you try to put your feet down flat or toes first your fins WILL get caught and tangled in the sand and the water and you'll feel like you're trapped. With fins on, move heel first.
    3. The key to going fast with fins is to "scissor kick". Keep your knees as straight as possible: your whole leg kicks, starting at the hip, and the fins to the extra work of pushing you far. Lots of people bend their knees and try to push off the water like they're jumping. Legs straight, toes pointed. (I'm pretty sure it's nearly physically impossible to actualy keep your legs straight, but try your best). [This video shows good technique.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNzI0rLGxSE)
3. Clear water from your mask.
    1. Close your eyes to prevent water from getting into your eyes. 
    2. While underwater, hold the top of your mask to your forehead and gently lift the bottom of your mask off your face. 
    3. Exhale through your nose, increasing the air pressure in your mask and letting the water fall out with gravity down your face. 
    4. You may need to tilt your head up towards the surface a bit to get the water to fall out.
    5. Press the mask back onto your face, maybe rearranging your skin/hair a bit to prevent further leaks.
4. Clear water from your snorkel.
    1. Modern snorkels have a one-way valve at the bottom to help clear air. You just need to blow hard, and the valve will open, letting the water out.
    2. If it's not clearing, kick your legs so the bottom of the snorkel is above water. Now all the water should just dribble out the valve at the bottom.
