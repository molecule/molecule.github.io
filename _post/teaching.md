### Molly's 61a page
Hello, and welcome to CS61a! I took this class as an undergrad back in 2011 and really loved it, so I'm very happy to be here.

### Inclusive Learning Statement
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

I encourage you to visit the Office of Disability Services to determine how you could improve your learning as well. If you need official accommodations, you have a right to have these met. There are also a range of resources on campus, including the Writing Center, Tutoring Center, and Academic Advising Center.

### My background
I'm a PhD student in CS here at Berkeley, and my research is in the sub-field of Human Computer Interaction. This means I like to think about how to design interesting, useful, and compelling user interfaces. Before I came to grad school, I worked on robots at Qualcomm. I didn't discover programming until I was a freshman in college in 2005.

### Land Acknowledgement
I recognize that my teaching and research work is located in the territory of Huichin, the ancestral and unceded lands of Chochenyo speaking Ohlone peoples, specifically, the Confederated Villages of Lisjan. The history of prolific technological development in this region has always depended on this land, and all of our technological infrastructures and activities take place on and in relation to this land. [Through the Berkeley Center for New Media, I commit to supporting the sovereignty and ongoing stewardship of this place by Ohlone peoples through building long-term reciprocity and relationships with tribal leaders and organizations.​](http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/about)
