        subTitle: Secret Headphones Paper (Title redacted until work is published)
        notes: Major absolute re-write. All new framework, new figures, new framing. Same demos, but telling a whole new story.
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_Question_727759.png
        finalResult: First submitted to DIS'21 (submission 18). Then significantly reworked (basically a new paper), and submitted to CHI'22 (submission 27). Reworked AGAIN for DIS'22 (this submission).

        conference: CnC'22
        subTitle: Secret creativity paper (Title redacted until work is published)
        secretTitle: Heuristics
        notes: I may have finally figured out what it is I'm trying to say. It also turns out that what I'm trying to say is something that's interesting to the folks at CnC, so I have fairly high hopes for this one.
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_Question_727759.png
        finalResult: Started life in 2019 (submission 10), then heavily reworked for CHI'20 (submission 13). Split into two papers with a different focus (submission 15 and 16), which went through revisions rounds at CSCW'21 where one was accepted (submission 21) and the other rejected (submission 23). CnC'22 will probably be the last attempt (this submission).

        conference: CHI'22
        subTitle: Secret Headphones Paper (Title redacted until work is published)
        notes: We thought we were really close with the last submission so we completely rewrote this and abandoned everything we had first discussed. Just kidding but also not really.

        subTitle: Secret VR Paper (Title redacted until work is published)
        secretTitle: AllTogether, Effect of Avatars in Hybrid Conferencing Environments
        notes: This paper has evolved - lots of co-authors with different home research methodologies, and finding the balance for everyone has been an interesting challenge! Also did you know that GROUP is not double-blind??
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_X_1890803.png

        subTitle: AirConstellations
        notes: An amazing project led by Nicolai Marquardt. This work is so inspiring, and I learned so much collaborating with all of these amazing researchers. I helped design some of the interaction techniques, and contributed to sections of the paper.

        conference: CSCW'22
        subTitle: Secret Creativity Project (Title redacted until work is published) 
        notes: I honestly knew in my heart that CSCW wasn't the right place for this paper. However, we got super lucky with the reviewers and one gave us absolutely incredible, thoughtful, detailed feedback.

        conference: CSCW'22
        subTitle: Friendscope; Shared Experiences on Camera Glasses
        notes: We re-wrote the Intro each time, trying to make things more clear. This was the best version for sure. We also got a bunch of excellent reviewer feedback, which definitely improved this paper.
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_checkmark_364806.png
        finalResult: Started life as submission 11. Then rejected from CHI (submission 12). Reworked a bit for IMWUT (submission 20). Eventually published at CSCW'22 (this submission). Total rejections before acceptance - 3 | <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08460">PDF</a>

        conference: CSCW'21
        subTitle: Towards Creative Version Control
        notes: The reviewers asked us to do additional interviews, which we did. It was a great suggestion - those interviews really helped clarify our claims.

        subTitle: Friendscope; Shared Experiences on Camera Glasses
        notes: Reworked our rejected CHI 2021 submission. It makes more sense for this conference anyway! REJECTED. The feedback was helpful, but I'll probably never submit to IMWUT again. I disliked everything about this process.

        subTitle: Secret Haptics Project (Title redacted until work is published)
        secretTitle: Taction; Exploring Expressive Micro-Haptics
        notes: Trying once again with our favorite haptics paper. This is definitely the best version of this paper that has ever existed, but still not good enough I guess. REJECTED, mainly because reviewers felt it was a bad fit (which is fair honestly - it was a stretch for CnC). R4 - 2, R3 - 2, R1 - 1, R2 - 2.

        secretTitle: Beyond Audio Control; Exploring the Design Space of Headphones as a Site for Interaction
        notes: A summer hackathon project from Microsoft we were all super excited about. Really weird scores - R4 - 2.5, R2 - 3.5, R1 - 3, R3 - 3. Seemed like it was juuuuuust about to get in.
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_X_1890803.png

        conference: DIS'21
        subTitle: Expanding the Design Space of Technology-Mediated Theatre Experiences paper.
        notes: My first first-author paper. I'm so so proud of this project, and super excited about how this work came together. It was honestly a disaster at first. About two weeks after the show closed, I moved down to Santa Monica where my laptop (with all of the user data from the audience interviews/surveys/etc) was stolen. Then, a year later (March 2020) I decided to work with another theatre group to recreate the project....3 days later everything shut down for COVID-19. It took me another 6 months to slowly iterate on a draft about the design process, which eventually became this paper.

        subTitle: Towards Creative Version Control
        notes: Significantly reworked versions of the rejected CHI'21 paper (submission x), now split into two papers. We were consistently getting feedback that the story was too messy but we had so much cool stuff to talk about so we wrote two full papers each with an entirely separate focus. R4 - 2.5, R3 - 2.5, R1 - 4, R2 - 2.

        subTitle: Secret VR Paper (Title redacted until work is published)
        secretTitle: All Together; Avatars in Hybrid Conferencing Environments to Enhance Co-presence
        notes: A paper from an amazing summer project lead by a fellow intern at Microsoft. I was asked if I wanted to contribute an hour and a half before the Abstract deadline...uh...yes???? I analyzed all the user data and wrote the user study section here. Reviews all 1.5s, so we only submitted a `thank you for your thoughtful feedback' rebuttal.
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_X_1890803.png

        subTitle: “It’s not garbage if I can evolve on it”; The Shifting Purposes, Goals, and Re-Uses of Artifacts in Diverse Creative Practices
        notes: Significantly reworked draft of submission 10 that had been rejected from DIS'20. We completely changed the structure and re-wrote it three times in the week leading up to the deadline. We were SO proud of it and hoped the reviewers would love it as much as we did! Spoiler - they did not. MetaReviewer R4 - 2.5; R1 (2AC) - 3; R5 - 2.5; R2 - 3; R3 - 2. We did get this encouraging note though - "This paper was discussed extensively during the PC meeting and the ultimately had a 3rd AC added to the review." It feels nice to know your paper was under discussion.

        subTitle: Investment vs Catalyst; A Design Ethnography of Documentation in Creative Practices
        notes: We LOVED this project and I think our love blinded us to the faults in our draft. Looking over the draft now, it's clear we didn't know what story we wanted to tell, and just dumped a bunch of semi-organized user quotes on the readers. Rejected!

        secretTitle: Towards Expressive Wearable Haptics Using MEMS Electrostatic Actuators
        notes: We absolutely refused to let this project die. Each submission we re-wrote massive chunks of it, trying to incorporate reviewer feedback whiel still staying true to our original vision/goal. It also got shorter and shorter each time.

        secretTitle: Millimeter Scale Haptics For MEMS-Based Wearables
        notes: Collaborating with another lab, we worked for several weeks to design and construct an extremely elaborate and delicate user study setup for testing something very delicate, then ran 18 participants. Ok, *running* user studies isn't my favourite part (I do like it), *analyzing* user data is my favourite part. In total our lab submitted 6 papers to CHI this year, and all 6 were rejected. Ouch!
        icon: /src/img/icon-noun_X_1890803.png
        finalResult: This paper started life for CHI'19 (submission 7). Then went to DIS'19 (submission 8), and ISWC'19 (submission 9), then CnC'21 (submission 19).

        notes: Recycled our paper from UIST 2018 - finally accepted! We did another user study to flesh out the world and expand our framework. I didn't help as much with this second round (mostly helped w the camera-ready and a bit with the video).

        conference: DIS'18
        subTitle: Guardians of Practice; A Contextual Inquiry of Failure-Mitigation Strategies within Creative Practices
        notes: One of my favorite research projects. Working on this shaped my thinking around all forms of creativity, and heavily influenced how I carry out research. This really sparked my interest in qualitative methods, and inspired me to imagine ways in which expertise from one creative practice can be imported into another. I helped with every aspect of this project, from original conception, study design, and interviews. This project originally started as part of a class, and we didn't decide to submit it until 24 hours before the deadline. We had no user study for this one, but I'm still very very proud of what we made. Honestly this has been the project that has most impacted my research life.

        conference: TEI'18
        subTitle: HairIO; Human Hair as Interactive Material
        notes: This project started existence as a paper that Christie had been working on for a while, and which had been rejected from UIST. She invited Sarah and I to collaborate with her, and when the deadline was extended by two weeks, we did a major brainstorming session and re-did nearly the whole thing. As with many of our lab’s papers, this project was highly collaborative. Christie was the lead when it came to design decisions, but we all contributed to writing the code, designing the circuit, framing the paper, planning the user study, and writing the paper. I was primarily responsible for running and analyzing the user study. I also did the filming and editing of the video. We worked stupidly hard for two weeks, then got a week-long deadline extension from the organizers of TEI. This filled us with rage and loathing, energy which we redirected to completely restructure our paper and run a full user study.

        conference: CHI'17
        subTitle: Illumination Aesthetics; Light as a Creative Material within Computational Design.
        notes: The first research paper I wrote. Joined the team 3 weeks before the CHI deadline. My personal contribution involved running and analyzing the user study - César trained me up with a few days left before the deadline. I was also responsible for synthesizing themes and writing the user study section of the paper (which was later specifically identified by reviewers as high quality). Jumping right into this project was an awesome way to get started with research. If you have a chance, I highly recommend getting involved with existing research when you start. I picked up a bunch of new skills and it really helped to get my hands dirty (so to speak) working on a research project. 
        finalResult: Accepted on first submission, won a Best Paper Award. | <a href="/src/papers/IlluminationAesthetics-chi2017.pdf">PDF</a>

This is a brief writeup of every "submission" I've made throughout my PhD. Some were accepted to become published papers right away, others have evolved over time and eventually been accepted as papers, others are still -- shall we say -- currently evolving.  I'm writing this with a few goals: 1) in the hopes of celebrating the submission (since that's the only part of the publication process I have control over) and 2) demystifying the publication cycle (and especially "failure") for others. This writeup was inspired by many others, including [Jeff Huang, who has presented a similar collection of 'paper journeys'](https://jeffhuang.com/struggle_for_each_paper/), [Leslie Lamport](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/pubs.html), and [Matt Keeter](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/#timeline).
