        title: Ant-Man and the Wasp
        review: At least they fixed Evangeline Lilly's hair? They still haven't figured out how to use Paul Rudd as the comedic lead though. Michael Peña is a treasure, but not utilized to his full extend in this one.

        title: Ant-Man
        review: Weirdly, Paul Rudd was not my favourite part of this movie. Also they somehow managed to make Evangeline Lilly unattractive. Michael Peña wins everything. Every scene with him is golden, but especially the last one.

        title: Mission Impossible 2
        review: Laughably bad! SO many slow motion scenes of Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton gazing soulfully at each other! Basically soft porn and/or exposition the rest of the time! We muted it and watched it in fast motion (which just emphasized the poor camera work and awkward editing). Some of the scenes still felt slow! Kind of a masterpiece of awfulness, really, and therein lies its charm if you can stomach it. Makes Solo look like a gem.

        title: Solo
        review: This movie was made by someone who has zero understanding of the fundamental appeal of Han Solo, which is someone who BELIEVES he can talk his way out of everything but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjEpLoL0ls">who actually is terrible at doing that.</a> This film made us realize the true spiritual successor to Ford's Han Solo is Chris Pratt's Starlord. Goofy, sweet, lucky, and just the right amount of bad-ass. The droid is the BEST character with the only couple of lines that made me laugh out loud.

        title: Mission Impossible (1996)
        review: Baby Tom Cruise! Not sure what else to say, it's a classic. Now I get the jokes about masks in the later ones! And why Ving Rhames was there! Why is one of main communication mediums British Airline flight attendants? How does their training look? "Sometimes you will need to insist that a customer watch a certain film, but do it VERY CRYPTICALLY".

        title: Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
        review: The female characters like and support one another while being honest. Also watching a teenage girls' mannerisms play out through Jack Black is surprisingly wonderful. I liked seeing what worked and didn't work with his/her techniques. That plot point was also never played for laughs, even when he was giving mouth to mouth, which I appreciate.

        title: Incredibles 2
        review: GORGEOUS animation. Weird message, boring misogynistic man-baby unable to feel happy for his wife's success, and of the two strong female friends one of them - surprise - turns out to be the bad guy. This took 14 years? Maybe they should've spent an extra 2 on the story. (Ok...that's incredibly harsh but I have high expectations. It's 2018).

        review: Snooze-fest. I love Rachel McAdams but even I can see she's wrong for the role of Irene Adler. Why can't Robert Downey Jr do a British accent? We didn't even finish film 2. Super lame lady characters.

        title: Ocean's 8
        review: Mindy Kaling is a treasure. Anne Hathaway was great. Rihanna stole her scenes. First 10 mins were phenomenal, then the momentum hit a brick wall and never recovered speed (crucial for comedy), so it really dragged.

        review: Really good. This event featured surprisingly large in my childhood (maybe the first "viral" news story I remember? That and Jon-Benet Ramsey's murder), so it was an interesting experience in nostalgia to see it on-screen. Cool and weird framing. Margot Robbie is excellent and Allison Janney is in top form (one of my all-time faves).

        review: Harrison Ford brings back the goofy affable Han Solo I know and love (fave character from the first movie). Rey is wonderful. Finn is wonderful, and Oscar Isaac is also super great. Classic Star Wars while still feeling fresh. BB-8!!! Oh, also, having a "dark side" character tempted by the light is actually FASCINATING. P.S. if you want to see what it looks like when a character pauses too long because the director is expecting applause, watch the scene where we first see Han Solo.

        review: For some reason, the monkey's monologue before they enter the whale made me laugh harder than I've laughed in the last twenty years, at least. I can't explain it. This film is gorgeous and wonderful. This movie taught me that the only thing you need to do to make two characters seem to like each other is have them smile at each other. They can still banter! They can disagree! But occasional smiles is all it takes to escape the horrible "sitcom nastiness" so endemic to writing these days.

        title: Looper
        review: I enjoyed it! I found Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup very distracting but I enjoyed it. Very sexist against men (implies that they NEED saving by some Special Soothing Female and otherwise would be monstrous and beastial is....offensive to say the least).

        title: Maleficent
        review: I enjoyed this. Angelina Jolie is captivating, but the story doesn't make sense. Nothing else memorable.

        title: Logan
        review: The thought of what happens to a mutant with mind-control powers as he ages is fascinating. Meeting a mini, rage-filled female Wolverine is WAY more fun than you might expect. Not only was the character wonderful, but it deepened Wolverine's character as well.

        title: Downsizing
        review: I only watched half of this, and it was only interesting insofar as it's obviously liberal propaganda to explain to privileged white dudes who feel like victims today that they have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

        title: Beauty and the Beast (live action)
        review: This is literally a shot-for-shot remake of the animated classic, but done in slow motion so none of the comedy works.

        review: This movie captured and gave voice to a part of our society that desperately needed it. Iconic.

        title: Joy
        review: Absolutely bizarre. This film chose a really weird framing and style but didn't really make it clear that's what it was doing until about 45 minutes in. Kinda meanders around and then just slams to a halt. I like weird movies, but what I like is the skill and craftsmanship in explaining the new universe and rules to the audience.

        review: This entire movie exists for the last 10 minutes of Tom Hanks' excellence and it is so so worth it.
