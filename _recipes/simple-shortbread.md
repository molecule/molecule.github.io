#### Ingredients
- 1 pound real butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 4 cups flour (if you use gluten-free flour, they have more crunch!)
- 1/4 teaspoon if using unsalted butter.

#### Steps
- Cream the butter and sugar together until well blended.
- Add one cup of flour at a time, mixing thoroughly. (If you're using regular flour, watch out for over-mixing. We use gluten-free flour so we don't need to worry about this).
- Once mixed, chill for half an hour.
- Divide in half. 
- Roll out until 1/4 inch thick.
- Cut into diamond shapes. Prick each cookie w a fork and sprinkle w sugar.
- Bake on ungreased cookie sheet in 325 deg oven for about 15 minutes or until the bottom starts to just brown.
