I"i<p>The theme of this year’s CHI was “Engage”. This time, I was lucky enough to be on both sides of engagement: I was enriched by many wonderful presentations, but I also had the amazing opportunity to share our work with the scholars in attendance. We were part of a session on Tangible, Embodied, and Wearable Interaction that included great work from Berkeley’s own Kimiko Ryokai on designing interfaces that capture and represent laughter.</p>

<p>Part of being a 2nd year graduate student is learning to develop your intuition about what makes good research. I operationalize this at conferences by carefully choosing which presentations I attend. Here are a subset of my favourite talks at this years CHI:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3173713">Displaying Invisible Objects: Why People Rarely Re-read E-books</a>. This awesome work by Jane Gruning investigates how the affordances of digital objects support or undermine long-term relationships with those objects. In particular, she talked about how the visibility of paper books results in positive ongoing behaviors such as re-reading, whereas current systems for electronic books don’t support such rich relationships. Aside from loving the focus on books as a site for research, her research methodologies and theoretical complexity in the discussion were new and fascinating to me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3174110">Design Within a Patriarchal Society: Opportunities and Challenges in Designing for Rural Women in Bangladesh.</a> I lived in Bangladesh for nearly a year with my family just after I had graduated from high school, and had a very tough time grappling with the extreme poverty. To hear an established researcher reframe the challenges there with such honesty and optimism moved me to tears.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3173944">Seeing What Is and What Can Be: On Sustainability, Respect for Work, and Design for Respect</a>. This was my first introduction to Ely Blevis, and like many in the audience I am now a permanent member of his fan club. His thoughtful approach to visual media as a way to engage with questions around how to design, the purpose of design, and the relationship of seemingly minute design choices to societal attitudes was deeply compelling.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3173656">Sketch&amp;Stitch: Interactive Embroidery for E-textiles</a>. Embroidery is one of my favourite forms of textile art, and the Sketch&amp;Stitch platform is all about combining that technique with electronics, in a way that maintains the ‘handedness’ that’s so important to so much of crafting. The authors even developed techniques to embroider sensors using conductive thread!</li>
</ul>

<p>There were so many more presentations about fresh new work: from design inquiries into our relationships with everyday objects to an awesome pop-up workshop in an alt.chi session critiquing the conservative ACM establishment. While it can be huge and overwhelming, my experience at CHI this year was intriguing, inspiring, and invigorating. I look forward to next year :)</p>
