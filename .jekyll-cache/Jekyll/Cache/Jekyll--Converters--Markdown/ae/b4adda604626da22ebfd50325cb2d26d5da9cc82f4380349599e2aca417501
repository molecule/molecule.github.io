    <td><small>Collaborating with another lab, we worked for several weeks to design and construct an extremely elaborate and delicate user study setup for testing something very delicate, then ran 18 participants. Ok, *running* user studies isn't my favourite part (I do like it), *analyzing* user data is my favourite part. In total our lab submitted 6 papers, and all 6 were rejected. Ouch! </small></td>

    <td><small>Recycled our paper from UIST 2018 - finally accepted! We did another user study to flesh out the world and expand our framework. I didn't help as much with this second round (mostly helped w the camera-ready and a bit with the video). </small></td>

    <td><small>Resurrected our Fall class project, edited it, and submitted it within 24 hours. We had no user study for this one, but I'm still very very proud of what we made. Honestly this has been the project that has most meta-impacted my research life. Read it and see if you can see why! </small></td>

    <td><small>Worked with Christie Dierk on her super cool wearable interfaces. Lots of circuit building and another 1-hr user study (quickly becoming my favourite part). </small></td>

    <td><small>Two weeks before the deadline for TEI, Christie Dierk, Sarah Sterman and I decided to resurrect one of Christie's earlier CHI-rejected papers. We worked stupidly hard for two weeks, then got a week-long deadline extension from the organizers of TEI. This filled us with rage and loathing, energy which we redirected to completely restructure our paper and run a full user study. </small></td>

    <td><small>Collaborated with César Torres again on an amazing project I can't talk about, since it's been resurrected. Ran a user study approximately.....4 days before the deadline? This one was rough. </small></td>

    <td><small>My first ever paper submission cycle! Worked with the truly inspiring César Torres and his graduate student Jasper O'Leary. Joined the project maybe 3 weeks after moving back to the Bay Area from San Diego. Had NO idea of what was going on, but learned so much. Learned how to run user studies and analyze qualitative data. Also learned that I need to be more explicit about not being able to work past 9pm :) </small></td>
