#### Abstract
As the landscape of wearable devices continues to expand,
power remains a major issue for adoption, usability, and miniaturization.
Users are faced with an increasing number of
personal devices to manage, charge, and care for. In this work,
we argue that power constraints limit the design space of wearable
devices. We present AlterWear: an architecture for new
wearable devices that implement a batteryless design using
electromagnetic induction via NFC and bistable e-ink displays.
Although these displays are active only when in proximity to
an NFC-enabled device, this unique combination of hardware
enables both quick, dynamic and long-term interactions with
persistent visual displays. We demonstrate new wearables
enabled through AlterWear with dynamic, fashion-forward,
and expressive displays across several form factors, and evaluate
them in a user study. By forgoing the need for onboard
power, AlterWear expands the ecosystem of functional and
fashionable wearable technologies.
