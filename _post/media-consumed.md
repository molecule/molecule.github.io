        title: Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik
        review: Unique retelling of the Rumpelstiltskin story but too YA for me.

        title: A Deadly Education by Naomi Novik
        review: Cool magic world but the focus of the plot and characters is too young adulty for me. It was all about feeling left out at lunchtime and worries about what others would think about clothing choices.

        review: Fantastic. So much fun. Phenomenally detailed and interesting magical system. Jaw-dropping twists. Favorite fantasy author writing now. Some of the dialogue in the first few books is awful, but for such a great series I got past it.

        title: Temeraire Series by Naomi Novik
        review: A TREASURE. Favorite new book series in 2021. Phenomenal characters in an amazing world. Positive and charming but suspenseful and intense. Best characterization of dragons I've ever read. Temeraire's nightmare still makes me laugh every time I think about it. Incredible.

        review: This movie was so bad! Tom Hardy is great. The best line is when Venom suggests tearing the heads off a bunch of bad guys and stacking the bodies in the corner. Tom says "why would we want to do that?" and Venom matter-of-factly replies "pile of heads pile of bodies". That kind of baffling, zany cultural miscommuncation between humans and aliens is what I live for.

We muted it and watched it in fast motion (which just emphasized the poor camera work and awkward editing). Even in fast motion, some of the scenes still felt slow! Kind of a masterpiece of awfulness, really, and therein lies its charm if you can stomach it. Makes Solo look like a gem.

Goofy, sweet, lucky, and just the right amount of bad-ass. The droid is the BEST character with the only couple of lines that made me laugh out loud.

That and Jon-Benet Ramsey's murder), so it was an interesting experience in nostalgia to see it on-screen. Cool and weird framing. Margot Robbie is excellent and Allison Janney is in top form (one of my all-time faves).

        review: Harrison Ford brings back the goofy affable Han Solo I know and love (fave character from the first movie). Rey is wonderful. Finn is wonderful, and Oscar Isaac is also super great. Classic Star Wars while still feeling fresh. BB-8!!! Oh, also, having a "dark side" character tempted by the light is actually FASCINATING. P.S. if you want to see what it looks like when a character pauses too long because the director is expecting applause, watch the scene where we first see Han Solo.

        review: For some reason, the monkey's monologue before they enter the whale made me laugh harder than I've laughed in the last twenty years, at least. I can't explain it. This film is gorgeous and wonderful. This movie taught me that the only thing you need to do to make two characters seem to like each other is have them smile at each other. They can still have sassy banter! They can disagree! But occasional smiles is all it takes to escape the horrible "sitcom nastiness" so endemic to writing these days.
