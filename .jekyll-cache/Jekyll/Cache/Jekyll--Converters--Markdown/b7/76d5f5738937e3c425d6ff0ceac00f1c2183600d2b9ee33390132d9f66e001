        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>Inch-thick bacon. Gorgeous ambience - would be a nice place to get married. Excellent coffee according to Matt so you know it's good. Country sourdough bread is phenomenal. <br /><br /></td>
        </tr>

    
        <tr> 
            <td><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hifJWvAPuCQYgkBQ6">Rodini Park</a></td>

        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>Hard to find in a business park (they validate parking for 90 minutes in the nearby parking structure). Fantastic gyros. The owner also invented something called Baklava Cheesecake. This kind of skill and inventiveness should be richly rewarded!! <br /><br /></td>
        </tr>

    
        <tr> 
            <td><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/N8H4jJNHHmYgxQwE9">Manpuku Tokyko BBQ</a></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>Parking is TOUGH unless you get here before 6. No neighborhood parking at all. Phenomenal quality of meat - possibly the best I've ever tasted. <br /><br /></td>
        </tr>

    
        <tr> 
            <td><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/uovo-santa-monica">Uovo</a></td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>The breakfast combos with eggs and bacon are fantastic. Perfectly cooked potatoes. The biscuit that came with the Country Breakfast was melt-in-your-mouth delicious biscuit perfection. Pastries are good too. <br /><br /></td>
        </tr>

    
        <tr> 
            <td><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-plate-taco-santa-monica">Blue Plate Tacos</a></td>

        <tr> 
            <td>The pork belly tacos are subtle, flavorful, and have a delicious texture. <br /><br /></td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>Fantastically delicious and rich. We tried and loved the Kashmiri Rogan Josh (a lamb dish), Butter Chicken (melt in your mouth), and a sweet potato dosa (this style of dosa is like an enormous extra-crispy crepe - so delicious). <br /><br /></td>
        </tr>

    
        <tr> 
            <td><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/merci-clement-santa-monica-5">Merci Clement</a></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>A dessert place only open at night. There's a high-def slow-mo video of dessert construction playing on loop to convince you these people are mad dessert scientists. The belgian waffle square w/ a scoop of ice cream is a joy. We're going back to try their insane cinnamon roll croissant. <br /><br /></td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td>Incredible and unique. Get the scallion pancakes, wontons in chili oil, sizzling pork potstickers, and for dessert a chocolate mochi donut and hedgehog bao. I didn't love the famous cheeseburger potstickers but they are VERY unique. <br /><br /></td>
