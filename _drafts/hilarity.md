The reason why Octopuses will never overtake the human race is primarily due to their lack of information transfer infrastructure: despite incredible intelligence and superior physical morphology, the unforgivingly harsh environment of the sea forever bars them from capturing the necessary knowledge to educate future generations and enable their rightful ascension to apex predator. Humans, however, have access to the written word, youtube, and napkins: a rich array of communication mediums that enable world-changing discoveries, leapfrog innovation, and scaffold incredible learning. The ability to access the thought process and learnings of our ancestors is one of the primary joys of being human, forever denied to our 8-legged nemeses.
