#### Mandarin Semi-Dwarf Clementine
1. Roots sensitive to too much water, so don't use potting mixes that retain water. Best may be rose garden soil mixes (formulated for outside use).[1]
2. Water about once per week. Only water if soil is dry ~2 inches down into soil. Yellow or cupped leaves may be overwatered. Citrus prefer infrequent, deep watering to frequent, shallow sprinklings.
3. Potting instructions[1]. In a container, water deeply once or twice a week [3].
4. Need full sun, 8 hours / day.
5. After first year, add citrus fertilizer (slow-release) in the Spring.
6. Pruning is fine except in winter. Well-pruned trees have higher fruit output and are less prone to branch breakage [1].
7. Citrus Problem Solver.[2]

#### Apache Thornless Blackberries
1. Needs rich, moist, soil and full sun exposure to thrive. 
2. Prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH ranging from 6.5 to 7. 
3. Space plants about 5 feet apart.
4. Require about an inch of water per week
5. If you don’t wish to trellis your plant, trim the tops of new canes during the summer months, limiting growth to about 3 to 4 feet.
6. In the spring, before new growth forms, prune lateral branches back to about 12 inches to encourage larger fruit production.
