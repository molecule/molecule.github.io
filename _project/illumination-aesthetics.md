#### Abstract
Recent digital fabrication tools have enabled new form-giving
using a wide range of physical materials. However, light
as a first class creative material has been largely ignored
within the design of our electronic objects. Our work expands
the illumination design space by treating light as a physical
material. We introduce a digital design tool that simulates
and visualizes physical light interactions with a variety of
materials for creating custom luminaires. We further develop
a computational design and fabrication process for creating
custom secondary optics elements (SOEs), which provides
additional handles for users to physically shape and redirect
light to compose, fill, and evenly diffuse planar and volumetric
geometries. Through a workshop study with novice electronic
designers, we show how incorporating physical techniques
to shape light alters how users view the role and function
of LEDs and electronics. We produce example pieces that
showcase how our approach expands the electronics aesthetic
and discuss how viewing light as material can engender novel,
expressive artifacts.
