this is a document that I'm writing. I am sitting in a gray chair. I am typing. I kind of want it to be lower on my back? But the legs feel good and the controls are easy.
This one works great partially reclined w crossed legs.
Sitting my feet are on the ground but i feel pushed forward 
Fully reclined isn't very full. But I can def work in full recline.
And lots of flexibility with changing the angle of the back, the headrest, without moving the feet. 
Cross-legged while reclined is ok. 
Weird positions are fine.
Can def put it into torture positions w/ the headrest too high.
Still not 100% sure but...maybe the best?

THis is the grey leather-like w white threading. Probably vinyl?? But the material feels fine.
THis one feels better! THe controls are hard to reach....I am very whiny!
When I try to adjust by pushing my feet against the foot-rest, it pushes itself down. But leaning way
farther back actually does feel ok! Maybe I'm trying to map my current behavior to another couch but wouldn't necessarily
do the same things in a new chair. 

The "cloud" poofy chair is no good in the "upright position": my feet are too far off teh floor.
First recline position: it doesn't really stick there so I feel like I can't totally relax.
Second recline: feels a little weird? Like too far back? Comfy though? 
Pretty comfy........
Now trying cross-legged in the upright position. It's fine! I maybe have to kind of strain my arms to keep the 
laptop held in the right spot. Can't put my feet on the ground.

This is the bronw hard one.
The controls are super easy to reach!
Now my legs are up and the back is up a bit. It's ok? They're all only ok.
I mean, it's fine? It's definitely fine. ANd I looove how flexible it is (so I don't have to commit!).
add a little cushin?
The headrest doesn't come forward as much as it goes up. So that doesn't work as well for me. 
Also it's the opposite of cradling my head.
Sitting all the way up w crossed legs feels comfy too. 
Weird sideways legs. Not as good but this is bad for me anyway.

The original brown microfiber w/ an x pattern
Can get a comfy position w/ it reclined.
Sitting cross-legged is ok. 
Other weird positions probably aren't that good. But that's probably good to discourage?
ok I can get a weird positions w/ the feet up. 
The one I'm trying is the loveseat, and the real recliner would have two arms which I am pretty srue I'd like more.
I think this one doesn't lift the legs up as much so it's not as comfortable in full recline or anything much less than 90.
